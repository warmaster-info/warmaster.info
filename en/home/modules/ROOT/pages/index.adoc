_Warmaster Revolution_ is a fan-based second edition of rules for the Warmaster game. Official rules are published in PDF format on the community website, https://www.wm-revolution.com/[wm-revolution.com].

This website contains the _Warmaster Revolution_ xref:revolution:rules:index.adoc[rules] and xref:revolution:armies:index.adoc[army lists] for easier electronic browsing and searching.  Some text has been reorganized or slightly reworded, based on similar changes in later editions of _Warmaster_, but _there are no changes to the rules of the game_.  These edits are marked with dotted underlines or coloured borders, see xref:revolution:rules:editors-note.adoc#website-editors-note[this explanation] for details.  Many minor spelling and grammer improvements are not marked.

Note the search box at the top of the page returns pages with _any one_ of the search words.  To force the results to contain a specific word, prefix it with a `+` as in `+Dark +Elves`.
