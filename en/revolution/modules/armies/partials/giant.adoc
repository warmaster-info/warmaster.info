// Paragraph break moved for hits.
Giants must always be given a separate order. They
cannot be brigaded with other troops, although several Giants
can be brigaded together if you so wish. If you attempt to give
an order to a Giant and fail then you must take a test to see what
it does. Ignore potential blunders - these are taken into account
by the following rules. Roll a dice and consult the Giant Goes
Wild chart. Where Giants are brigaded together roll for each
separately.
+
Giants have a great many hits, 8 in fact, which are
almost impossible to inflict during even a fairly lengthy combat
engagement.
Because Giants have so many hits we must consider the
possibility of hurting the Giant and reducing its effectiveness
in subsequent turns. Therefore, if a Giant has accumulated 5-7
hits by the end of the Shooting phase or Combat phase and is no
longer engaged in combat it is deemed to have been badly hurt.
Once a Giant is badly hurt all accumulated hits are discounted
and its maximum Hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest
of the battle (to 4 Hits and 4 Attacks).
+
A Giant causes terror in
its enemies.

|D6 |Oh no! Whatâ€˜s he doing now!

|1
|The Giant will neither move nor fight this turn but
simply stands rooted to the spot looking dopey.

|2
|Move the Giant directly towards the nearest table edge.
If he moves into another unit he will charge it regardless
of which side it is on. If victorious in combat the Giant
will hold his ground.

|3
|The Giant throws an object at the closest visible unit
(friend or foe) within 5xD6 cm, inflicting 3 Attacks. If the
target is in combat, the attacks contribute to the combat
result; otherwise, resolve them in the Shooting phase.

|4
|The Giant moves straight forward at full pace in the
direction he is facing in. If he reaches an enemy unit he
will charge. If he reaches a friendly unit he will walk
straight through and out the other side if there is room
and he has sufficient move. If he reaches a friendly unit
and does not have sufficient move or enough room to
walk all the way through then he halts on contact. A
friendly unit that is walked through or contacted in this
way instantly becomes confused as a result.

|5
|The Giant moves towards the nearest enemy unit that
he can see as fast as he can. If he reaches the foe he will
charge. If friends are in the way he will walk through
them causing confusion as described above. If there is
no visible enemy the Giant does nothing this Command
phase.

|6
|The Giant gives a mighty bellow and rushes straight at
the nearest enemy unit that he can see. Move the Giant at
double his normal full pace move. If he reaches an enemy
unit, he charges it and fights by jumping up and down on
the foe, furiously doubling his Attacks value in the first
round of combat. If there is no visible enemy the Giant
does nothing this Command phase.
