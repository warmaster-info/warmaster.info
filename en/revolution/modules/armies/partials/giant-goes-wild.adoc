|D6 |Oh no! Whatâ€˜s he doing now!

|1
|The Giant will neither move nor fight this turn but
simply stands rooted to the spot looking dopey.

|2
|Move the Giant directly towards the nearest table edge.
If he moves into another unit he will charge it regardless
of which side it is on. If victorious in combat the Giant
will hold his ground.

|3
|The Giant throws an object at the closest visible unit
(friend or foe) within 5xD6 cm, inflicting 3 Attacks. If the
target is in combat, the attacks contribute to the combat
result; otherwise, resolve them in the Shooting phase.

|4
|The Giant moves straight forward at full pace in the
direction he is facing in. If he reaches an enemy unit he
will charge. If he reaches a friendly unit he will walk
straight through and out the other side if there is room
and he has sufficient move. If he reaches a friendly unit
and does not have sufficient move or enough room to
walk all the way through then he halts on contact. A
friendly unit that is walked through or contacted in this
way instantly becomes confused as a result.

|5
|The Giant moves towards the nearest enemy unit that
he can see as fast as he can. If he reaches the foe he will
charge. If friends are in the way he will walk through
them causing confusion as described above. If there is
no visible enemy the Giant does nothing this Command
phase.

|6
|The Giant gives a mighty bellow and rushes straight at
the nearest enemy unit that he can see. Move the Giant at
double his normal full pace move. If he reaches an enemy
unit, he charges it and fights by jumping up and down on
the foe, furiously doubling his Attacks value in the first
round of combat. If there is no visible enemy the Giant
does nothing this Command phase.
