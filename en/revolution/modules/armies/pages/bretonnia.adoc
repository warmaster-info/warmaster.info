Bretonnia has grown into a powerful and influential nation
under the leadership of its proud King Leoncour. At the
capital of Couronne the greatest knights gather to attend their
king and to accept from him such heroic quests as he chooses
to set them. To the knights of Bretonnia honour is everything
and it is an undoubted fact that a knight would sooner die than
bring dishonour upon himself or his lord.

The realm of Bretonnia is not as ancient as that of the Empire.
For many hundreds of years the various tribes that inhabited
this region fought amongst themselves. Many were little more
than brigands who roamed the land pillaging and looting at
will. Implacable rivals vied for power whilst raids and wars
despoiled the land. This long period of anarchic conflict ended
with the founding of the nation under the visionary warlord
Gilles Le Breton. Not only did this great warrior subjugate
all the other powers in the land but he instigated the laws of
chivalry that were to bind them to a common purpose. The
wars of internal strife were ended with a blow of the sword
and a new nation and a new vision arose from the battle’s mire.

The laws of chivalry govern Bretonnian society to this day
informing alike the high ideals of the knights and the simple
coda of the peasants. Because these laws are now so old –
and because they have been re-interpreted and occasionally
misconstrued over the years – many now appear quite bizarre
or pointless. However, the Bretonnians make a great thing
of enforcing these laws nonetheless. For the most part they
describe the feudal status of different classes, rights attaining to
the ownership of property, definitions and distinctions within
the strict social order, and the duties and responsibilities due to
each class from the others.

Much heed paid to proper modes of address between the
classes, to the means of settling petty priorities between folk
of comparable standing, and to the many special forms of
respect owed to superiors of distinct ranks. All this serves to
keep everyone in their place especially the peasantry – who are
inferior to everybody and quite right too.

The nobles of Bretonnia aspire to the high ideals of knighthood
and train from early youth in the arts of war. They are skilled
and hardy warriors who live to fight. They frequently engage
in fiercely competitive mock battles and tourneys between
themselves. Knighthood is an honour and one that can only
be earned by the performance of heroic deeds – such matters
usually involve slaying troublesome monsters, destroying
roving bands of Orcs, and suchlike. During their lives Knights
will often undertake further adventures and may be compelled
to fight powerful enemies as a form of penance or spiritual
journey. Knights acquire honour and rise in status as a mark of
their heroism, talking priority over lesser Knights and earning
certain privileged titles and badges of honour.

The most renowned of all Knights are those who quest for
the Grail of the Lady of Bretonnia. The Lady is the protective
deity of the nation and its rulers. She is said to have aided
Gilles le Breton by appearing before him on the eve of a great
battle. The Lady bade Gilles drink from her grail which he did
unhesitatingly. As he drank the Lady vanished and Gilles, now
suddenly sure of what he needed to do, went on to destroy his
enemies and become king. Since that time the Bretonnians have
built many shrines to The Lady. The greatest deed a Knight can
undertake is to search for the Grail of The Lady – the damsels
of The Lady grant this quest only to the bravest and most strong
hearted for few who begin the quest are ever fated to succeed.

== Special rules

=== Army rules

Feudal Society:: The Bretonnian army is essentially an army of
Knights and it is the Knights’ contribution to the battle that
counts – never mind the pot-washers and clod-breakers. To
represent this, the Bretonnian army calculates when it must
withdraw from the battle in a different way to other armies.
Instead of counting all of its units at the start of the game, count
only the number of units of Knights, Grail Knights and Pegasus
Knights. Once the army has lost half or more of its units of
Knights/Grail Knights/Pegasus Knights it must withdraw.

=== Special rules

{empty}1. Peasants:: A unit of Peasants suffers an additional −1 Command
penalty when given an order. However, this penalty is waived
if the Peasant unit is part of a brigade that includes at least
one non-Peasant unit. Peasants cannot use initiative to charge –
though they can use initiative to evade as usual. Peasants
are able to make supporting charges. When they charge they
receive no bonus attack modifier for doing so.

2. Knights:: A Knight unit will always use its initiative to charge
an enemy if possible and cannot be given orders instead. They
will never use their initiative to evade. Knights are unaffected
by enemy that cause terror in combat and they don’t suffer the
usual −1 Attack modifier.

3. Grail Knights:: If the unit of Grail Knights is charging against
an enemy in the open it receives an additional +1 Attack
modifier in the same way as chariots and monsters.

4. Pegasus Knights:: Pegasus Knights can fly.

5. Trebuchet:: The Bretonnian Trebuchet is one of the mightiest
and most excellent stone throwers that are built in the Old
World. At first it was designed to help the noble knights with
the sometimes coming up and messy sieges that had to be done
but later was adjusted to be used in field battles too. As the
Trebuchet is so gargantuan, it uses a 40 x 60mm base, with the
short edge being the front.
+
To represent that the Trebuchet is such a bulky warmachine,
which takes time to assemble and disassemble, the Trebuchets
can move but cannot shoot in the turn it moved.
+
If a Trebuchet is driven back more than 10cm by shooting it is
destroyed (drive backs of less than 10cm are simply ignored). If
it is forced to retreat from combat it is also destroyed like any
other artillery. A Trebuchet is not affected by Gerroff!!! spell.
+
The Trebuchet has a shooting range of 80cm. Fortified units
count as defended and defended targets count as in the open.
No armour roll is made when shot at by a Trebuchet.
+
The Trebuchet may not shoot at charging enemies.
+
The Trebuchet can shoot at targets that it can see as for all
other artillery, and it can shoot over the heads of friends and
obstacles on lower ground just as can other artillery.
+
Shooting Blind: If there is no target in sight a Trebuchet may
instead shoot at the nearest enemy unit in range it cannot see.
When Shooting Blind it always hits on 6+ no matter if the target
is in the open, defended or even fortified.

6. Unicorn:: Only an Enchantress can ride a Unicorn. The
Unicorn adds +1 to the Enchantress’s Attacks. Once per battle
the Unicorn’s magical power adds +1 to the dice roll when
casting a spell. The player must announce that he is using the
Unicorn’s magic before rolling to see if the spell works.

7. Pegasus:: The Pegasus can be ridden by a General, Hero or
Enchantress and adds +1 Attack to the rider as well as allowing
the character to fly.

8. Hippogriff:: Only a General can ride a Hippogriff. The
Hippogriff can fly. A unit joined by the General on Hippogriff
causes terror.

9. Grail Reliquae:: This sacred item can be given to one unit
of Peasants only in a whole army. This unit and all Peasant
units touching it become Grail Pilgrims (for as long as they
keep contact). Grail Pilgrims are immune to terror, don’t get
the −1 Command penalty and get +1 Attack (they still keep the
restriction that they don’t get +1 Attacks for charging in the
open), they have to attack by initiative if possible and cannot be
driven back or confused. Before taking any specific action with
a Peasant unit check if they are still touching the unit carrying
the Grail Reliquae. If they do so they count as Grail Pilgrims – if
not they are simple Peasants.

=== Bretonnian spells

==== Shield of Combat

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_The enemy’s blows are magically deflected by unseen forces
and cause no harm._

An Enchantress can cast this spell upon a unit that she has
joined. The spell lasts until the end of the opposing player’s
following turn.

The unit can re-roll any failed armour rolls during the Combat
phase. This does not include hits suffered from enemy missile
fire during a charge, as these are deemed to be shooting hits and
are encompassed by the Aerial Shield spell.

Note that only a single re-roll is permitted regardless of what
other factors apply. It is never permitted to re-roll a re-roll in
any circumstances.

==== Eerie Mist

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_An eerie mist rises about the enemy unit stifling the sights and
sounds of battle._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the Enchantress can see it or not. The spell lasts
until the end of the opposing player’s following turn.

The unit cannot use its initiative. Any order given to the unit,
or to any brigade of which it is a part, suffers a −1 Command
penalty.

==== Aerial Shield

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The enemy’s missiles sparkle in the sunlight and vanish
magically in mid-air causing no harm to their target._

This spell can be cast on a friendly unit whether the Enchantress
can see it or not.

The spell lasts until the beginning of the next Bretonnian
Shooting phase.

All enemies that shoot at the enchanted unit get −1 on
shooting rolls. But keep in mind that regardless of all other
circumstances the shooting may never get worse than 6+. So
even if the enchanted unit is fortified all enemies still hit on 6+.

==== Lady’s Favour

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A vision of The Lady appears to lead the Bretonnians into the
midst of battle or away from danger._

The spell can be cast on any unengaged friendly unit within
range regardless of whether the Enchantress can see it or not.
The spell affects only a single unit, never a brigade and there is
no supporting charge possible..

The unit can be moved just as if it had received an order in the
Command phase. Character stands that have joined the unit
will not move with it: they remain where they are.
