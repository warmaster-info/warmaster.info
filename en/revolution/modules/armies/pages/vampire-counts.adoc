Upon the eastern marches of the Empire lies the blighted
land of Sylvania. It is a region dominated by dark forests
and bleak mountains. For the most part its inhabitants are
poor, for the soil is thin and unprofitable to work, whilst the
mountains are devoid of the mineral wealth found in abundance
to the south and north. Moreover the land has an unfortunate
reputation. Its forests are said to be haunted and the ground
itself is thought to carry the contagion of Chaos so that even the
dead that are buried in it do not rest easily. Those who live there
are few in number, impoverished, malnourished, and utterly
lacking in ambition and vigour. The ordinary folk of the land
are broken in spirit and live in harsh servitude under callous
and uncaring masters.

Although part of the Empire from its inception, Sylvania
developed quite separately during the long period of anarchy
known as the Age of Three Emperor‘s when all centralised
government broke down. In these years a new power arose in
Sylvania taking the form of the Counts Carstein. The Carsteins
quickly gained a reputation for cruelty that surpassed anything
that had ever happened before in the Empire. Throughout the
adjoining lands, stories were whispered of ghastly tortures and
wanton cruelty, of necromancy and dark magic, and of the
haunting of the land by restless spirits. People feared to walk
abroad after nightfall for strange creatures stalked the night -
creatures that feasted on the blood and flesh of men.

The true nature of the Carsteins emerged during the years that
followed the coming of the comet and destruction of the city of
Mordheim. It was a time of great contagion when the power
of magic waxed strongly throughout the Empire. Harnessing
much of that magic the great Vlad Von Carstein raised an army
of dead from the poisoned soil and made his bid for the throne
of the Empire.

Thus began the Wars of the Vampire Counts in which the dead
sought to overthrow the living and the Carsteins sought to rule
the whole of the Empire. Had they succeeded the Empire would
have become a dead land where the living would exist only as
cattle to feed a Vampiric nobility. Vlad almost did succeed but
was slain as his undead hordes besieged Altdorf.

Vlad‘s successors were to continue the war at first led by
the insane Konrad Von Carstein and then by Mannfred Von
Carstein. The armies of the dead ranged over the lands of the
Empire until Mannfred was eventually driven back to Sylvania
and defeated at the battle of Hel Fenn. After that battle
Mannfred disappeared, presumed destroyed, but his body was
never found and rumours of his return haunt the Empire to this
day. Following this defeat Sylvania was scoured by the priests
of Sigmar and many vampires were hunted out and destroyed.
Syvlania itself was claimed by the Count of Stirland and now
forms part of that province.

It remains a land of dread where the downtrodden peasantry
still live in terror of the night and the things that walk beneath
the moon.

== Special rules

=== Army rules

The following rules for Undead apply to all units except for
Ghouls. Ghouls are considered to be ordinary mortal troops
and the following rules do not apply to them.

Undead:: Undead units never act on initiative. An Undead unit
only moves in the Command phase if given orders (aside from
Fell Bats which can ‘homeback‘ as noted below). Including an
Undead unit cannot make a supporting charge to support an
unit of Ghouls charging on initiative.
+
Undead units are unaffected by the -1 Command penalty for
enemy within 20cm.
+
Undead units are unaffected by the -1 Combat penalty for
fighting terrifying troops.
+
Undead units are unaffected by the Confusion rule - they
cannot become confused for any reason.

=== Special rules

{empty}1. Ethereal Host:: Ethereal Host Attacks always inflict a hit on
a score of 4+ regardless of whether the enemy is in the open,
defended, or fortified. Enemy otherwise count as in the open,
defended, or fortified in all respects (i.e. charge bonuses count
or don‘t count depending on status). Ethereal hosts cannot be
driven back by shooting and do not roll for drive backs. They
cause terror as described in the Warmaster rulebook. Ethereal
Hosts cannot have magic items.

2. Dire Wolves:: If the unit charges against an enemy in the open
it receives an additional +1 Attack modifier in the same way as
chariots and monsters. Dire Wolves cannot have magic items.

3. Fell Bats:: Fell Bats can fly. Although they cannot use initiative
they are allowed to home back as described in the Warmaster
rulebook. No order is required to home back. Fell Bats are an
exception to the normal rules for basing monsters, in that they
are based along the long base edge in the same way as infantry,
rather than the short edge like other monsters.

4. Vampire Lords:: These are powerful sorcerers as well as the
army‘s general. They can cast spells in the same way as a wizard
and can be given a magic item restricted to either a General or
a Wizard. Note that the Vampire Lord is still a General and his
command range extends over the whole battlefield as for other
Generals.

5. Winged Nightmare:: Any character can ride a Winged
Nightmare. A winged Nightmare can fly increasing its rider‘s
move to 100cm and adding +2 to its rider‘s attacks. A unit joined
by a character riding a Nightmare causes terror in its enemies.

6. Black Coach:: A Vampire Lord or Vampire can be mounted
within a Black Coach adding +1 to its occupant‘s attacks. A unit
joined by a character riding in the Black Coach causes terror in
its enemies.

=== Vampire Counts spells

==== Raise Dead

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_At the Wizard‘s beckoning the mangled corpses that litter the
battleground rise from the dead to continue the slaughter._

This spell can be cast upon a combat engagement taking place
within 30cm of the Wizard. The spell can be cast regardless
of whether the Wizard can see any units in the combat
engagement or not. A single combat engagement can only be
affected once by this spell in any turn regardless of how many
units are involved in the combat. For purposes of deciding
whether a combat is eligible as a target, combat engagements
are as they appear when the die to cast the spell is rolled: so it
is possible for pursuit or advances to bring two units of raised
dead into the same engagement later on.

A Skeleton unit of three stands is created. Each stand in the
raised unit must be placed so that its front edge contacts an
enemy stand from the targeted engagement, or that it supports
a friendly stand from the same engagement, including raised
stands. The placement of stands may not split up the engagement
into multiple smaller engagements. If raised stands come into
contact with unengaged enemy units, those units will join the
engagement after the raised unit is placed, similar to incidental
contact during pursuit. If it is impossible to position all stands
in combat or support then the unit is not deployed and the spell
fails. Raised dead do not count as charging in the first round of
combat. Raised dead are ignored for working out break point
and victory points at the end of the game.

==== Vanhel’s Danse Macabre

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 40cm#

_The bodies of the dead move under the powerful influence of
necromantic magic renewing their vigour once more._

This spell can be cast on any friendly unit apart from Ghouls.
The spell can be cast on a unit within range regardless of
whether the Wizard can see it or not. The spell affects only a
single unit, never a brigade and there is no supporting charge
possible.

The unit can be moved just as if it had received an order in the
Command phase. Character stands that have joined the unit
will not move with it: they remain where they are.

==== Death Bolt

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A fearsome bolt of sorcerous lightning flies from the Wizard‘s
outstretched finger tips and strikes an enemy unit._

The Necromancer must be able to see his target to cast this
spell and it cannot be directed against a unit in combat. The
Deathbolt is treated like three ordinary shooting attacks
except that armour has no effect (all targets count as having
no armour). A unit can be driven back by Deathbolt as with
ordinary shooting.

==== Curse of Years

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_The Wizard‘s enemies crumble to dust as he smites them with
the corrupting Curse of Years._

The Wizard can cast this spell if he has joined a unit in combat.
The spell can be cast on any single enemy unit that is touching
the unit the Wizard has joined.

The target unit takes six attacks worked out in the usual way.
Any hits scored are carried over into the first round of combat
and count as having been struck in the first round for purposes
of working out combat results.
