Far to the east of the Old World lie the savage Ogre Kingdoms.
Among the frozen and desolate mountains of this realm live
the Ogres – ugly, violent monsters who kill and eat anything
they can catch.

An Ogre Kingdoms army is a massive, blunt instrument that
smashes into enemy lines with the force of a ton of bricks. It is
a hard-hitting army that will normally be vastly outnumbered
on the battlefield. Nevertheless, with the right combination of
Ogre units led by a fearsome Tyrant an opponent’s lines can
be ripped asunder by a devastating bull charge even before a
single ironbound club is swung. A single Ogre has enough brute
strength to destroy a farmstead or village. Thus, the ramshackle
armies that march west from the Ogre homelands are powerful
enough to destroy empires.

// machinerys → machines
Ogres have been described by scholars as ‘thick as two short
planks‘. They have also been described as having enough
intelligence to nail the planks together and beat the observer to
a bloody pulp. There is some truth to this, for although the race
is unable to create anything of lasting worth, they do have a
knack for cobbling together crude weaponry out of whatever is
to hand, and even using the machines of war they take, trade
or earn from other races.

// add 'use'
That said, the Mountains of Mourn are so inhospitable that
nothing that makes its way into the Ogre Kingdoms is wasted -
if an object is not immediately edible it will invariably find
another use within a few hours of its discovery.

// . → , after food, tor → for, comers → corners
Ogres have an insatiable appetite for destruction as well as for
food, and even in times of relative peace they will hunt and
kill the vicious cave-beasts that dwell in the mountains, as well
as war constantly amongst themselves. Ogres are well known
for their tendency to brawl, and can be found across the four
corners of the world, fighting in small mercenary groups that
ultimately leave comparatively little evidence of their passing.
In contrast, a full migration of Ogres can be devastating,
stripping all life from the lands they come across and devouring
entire populations in a matter of days. It may take decades
before the desolation left in their wake begins to recover, but
full-scale Ogre migrations are mercifully rare.

// Capital Kingdoms
Ogres, being completely illiterate, rely on crude cave paintings
and a tradition of storytelling (or just plain old boasting) to
convey the folk tales and legends of their civilisation. One
of their earliest myths concerns Old Stoneguts, an Ogre that
caught and ate the sun one evening but, due to the heartburn
it was causing him, threw it back up the very next morning.
Ogres place great stock in feats of strength, and the mythology
of the Ogre Kingdoms is continually fuelled by the Herculean
(and often extremely exaggerated) tasks undertaken by its
inhabitants.

== Special rules

////
2: Remove duplicative The unit has 2 shooting attacks.
4: This unit
5: standard -1 command penalty, the usual
6: Paragraph break moved
////
{empty}1. Bull Ogres:: If an Ogre unit can use its initiative to charge an
enemy unit of humans at the start of the Command phase then
it must do so. This happens automatically and their commander
can do nothing about it. ‘Humans’ encompasses all men
including Chaos Warriors and Marauders, but not Dwarfs,
Elves etc.

2. Leadbelchers:: Leadbelchers‘ cannons have a range of 15cm.
Leadbelchers’ shooting attacks
impose a -1 penalty to armour rolls.

3. Yhetees:: If the unit of Yhetees is charging against an enemy
in the open it receives an additional +1 Attack modifier in the
same way as chariots and monsters. A Yhetee unit can only
give support and be supported by other Yhetee units and must
pursue retreating enemies where possible and must advance
into a combat if they are able to do so.

4. Gnoblars:: This unit is allowed to shoot as if it had bows but its
range is reduced to 15cm. A Gnoblar stand cannot be supported
by other kinds of infantry - only by other Gnoblar stands. Note,
however, that Gnoblars can support other kinds of infantry
as normal. Gnoblars cannot be given magic items. Characters
cannot join Gnoblar units.

5. Gorgers:: When trying to issue an order to a unit of Gorgers or
to a brigade that contains a unit of Gorgers, there is always a -1
Command penalty due their beastly and unruly nature. Gorgers
always ignore distance modifiers when receiving orders and can
pursue any type of retreating enemy.
+
Gorgers do not have to be
deployed before the game if the player does not wish to do so.
Instead individual units can be infiltrated onto the battlefield
once the game has begun. To infiltrate a unit, the Ogre player
nominates the point where he wants the Gorgers to appear and
issues an ‘infiltration‘ order from any character. The character
does not have to be within his normal command range to
issue an infiltration order - the character‘s command range is
considered to extend over the entire tabletop when issuing an
infiltration order. Treat the order as issued to the nominated
point, and apply the Gorgers‘ standard -1 command penalty and any modifiers for
proximity of enemy. The nominated point must lie either on the
table within dense terrain or on any base edge other than the
enemy player‘s own table edge. If successful, place one stand
on the nominated spot and arrange the rest of the unit into
formation around it. The infiltrated unit cannot be placed so
that it touches an enemy unit. Once deployed, orders can be
given to the unit by the same character that gave the infiltration
order. The infiltrating unit is considered to have used its first
order to deploy. If the infiltration order is failed the unit is
not deployed and cannot infiltrate that turn, it can attempt to
infiltrate in a subsequent turn at the same or a different place.
+
Gorgers don‘t suffer the usual -1 Command penalty for Dense Terrain.

6. Rhinox Riders:: Units of Rhinox Riders are unaffected by
terror. Rhinox Riders receive +1 Attack when charging against
an enemy in open in the same way as chariots and monsters.

5. Slave Giant::
include::partial$giant.adoc[]

8. Scrap Launcher:: Scrap Launcher is a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#stone-thrower[Stone Thrower] as
described in the Warmaster Rulebook.

9. Bull Rhinox:: Tyrants, Bruisers and Butchers may ride the Bull
Rhinox. A unit that is joined with a character mounted on this
huge beast causes terror in enemies.
