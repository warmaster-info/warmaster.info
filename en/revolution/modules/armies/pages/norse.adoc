The northern regions of the Old World suffer from extremes
of climate and geography unlike anywhere else. The dense
dark forests, high barren mountains, icy seas and long winter
nights conspire to make life here both hard and short. This
cruel land known as Norsca is a home to the Norsemen - a
race of men that are as fierce, brutal and unforgiving as the
landscape itself.

Because little grows upon the rocky soil of the North the
Norsemen have traditionally turned to the sea for their
livelihood. Their Kingships and Longships set out for the shores
of Albion the coasts of the Old World and even further afield
bringing warriors to pillage and extort what they require.
Occasionally they will trade with other races or hire themselves
out as mercenaries in return for goods but most of the time
they will simply fight to get what they want. It is said that the
Norsemen love war-song and ale but most of all they love war.
Old Worlders tell horrifying tales of these berserk warriors
from over the Sea of Claws looting and burning from their
dragon headed vessels and ravaging the northern coasts of The
Empire and Kislev.

The Norsemen are known as excellent sailors and fearless
warriors given to great voyages and adventures; the most
wayward of the Norse raiders have sailed as far as Ulthuan
and The Southlands bringing home tales of strange lands,
immeasurable wealth and wild creatures.

The Norsemen are famously fond of their ale, so much so that
they’ve been known to wage war to obtain a decent stock for
the winter. However, some Norsemen whenever they have
more than the slightest drop of Mead go into a berserk frenzy,
where they feel no pain and fear nothing. A bit annoying in the
Mead Hall, but very useful on the battlefield.

== Special rules

////
2: or be, remove at all
4: some rewording of the siege attack
////

{empty}1. Berserkers:: Such is the eagerness to get into combat that a
unit of Berserkers will always use its initiative to charge an
enemy if possible and can’t be given orders instead. They’ll
never use their initiative to evade. They can’t be driven back by
shooting and do not roll for drive backs. If victorious in combat,
they must pursue or advance where possible. Berserkers are
unaffected by enemies that cause terror in combat, so they do
not suffer the usual -1 Attack modifier.

2. Ulfwerener:: Unlike usual infantry troops, the Ulfwerener
are based facing the short edge in the same way as cavalry. In
addition they receive an additional +1 Attack modifier when
they charge an enemy in the open in the same way as monsters
and chariots and have an ability to pursue cavalry and chariots
troop types. The Ulfwerener stands can never support or be
supported. Because of their rather bestial nature, only
characters with the Were Kin Character upgrade may join units
of Ulfwerener. Ulfwerener units can not take any magic items.

3. Storm Giant::
include::partial$giant.adoc[]

4. War Mammoth:: As the Mammoth is so gargantuan, it uses a
40 x 60mm base, with the short edge being the front. It causes
terror and may attack troops on ramparts with its trunk in the
same manner as a Giant. Alternatively, it may elect to batter a
wall section or gateway with its tusks in the same manner as a
battering ram.
+
During a siege a Norse War
Mammoth in base contact with a wall section permits one Norse
infantry unit to assault that wall section via the Mammoth.
The infantry climb ladders and ropes at the rear of the Mammoth and
use boarding ramps and the like to assault the fortress walls.
This is not quite as effective as assaulting from a siege tower, so
the enemy only counts as defended rather than
in the open.
+
If a
unit assaults in this manner, then the War Mammoth may not
attack with its trunk or batter the walls; such action would
result in attacking friendly troops or bringing a wall section
down from under them.
+
If a War Mammoth has accumulated 6-9 hits by the end of the
Shooting phase or Combat phase and is no longer engaged in
combat it is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Mammoth
is badly hurt then all accumulated hits are discounted and its
maximum Hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest of the
battle (to 5 Hits and 4 Attacks).

5. Valkyries:: Valkyries can fly. Valkyries will always use their
initiative to charge an enemy if possible and cannot be given
orders instead. They will never use their initiative to evade.
Valkyries are unaffected by enemy that cause terror in combat
and they don’t suffer the usual -1 Attack modifier.

6. Were Kin:: The Were Kin special mount option may be taken
by any character in Norse army. It is not actually a mount as
such, more an upgrade. A unit that is joined by the character
with the Were Kin upgrade causes terror in its enemies. No
terrain restriction apply for Were Kin - just treat the character
as having +1 extra Attack and causing terror.

7. Horn of Resounding:: A single shaman in the army may be
given this chariot upgrade. It gives the shaman +1 Attack if
the Horn is used the Shaman inspires the units around him to
fight harder. He may add +1 to all of his Command checks for
a single turn only.

=== Norse spells

==== Aspect of Wulfen

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Shaman turns the friendly unit into an illusive pack of
monstrous creatures entailing the fear in a hearts of enemies._

This spell can only be cast on any friendly unit within range
regardless of whether the Shaman can see it or not. The unit
counts as causing terror for the duration of the Combat phase.

==== Thunder of Fo’Wor

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

// bolt, comma
_A lightning bolt shoots from the Shaman’s outstretched arm, burning
all in its path._

Draw an imaginary line 30cm long from the Shaman’s stand
in any direction you wish. The line will pass through any
intervening units but not beyond terrain that would normally
stop a missile shot, e.g. over the crest of a hill, more than 2cm of
woodland, and so forth.

Each unit under the line takes three shooting attacks worked
out in the usual way. Note that this spell can easily affect
several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line
(including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back by a
Thunder of Fo’Wor as with ordinary shooting (even including
friends). Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Thunder
of Fo’Wor but carry over any hits scored into the first round
of combat; any hits scored count as having been struck in the
combat itself.

==== Eye of the Raven

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

// Tense
_The Shaman sacrifices a sacred Raven over a mystical flame.
Ingesting the ash that is quickly formed gives him visions._

The Norse player may re-roll a single D6 at any time during the
rest of his turn, through his opponents turn or in his following
turn up to the end of his next Command phase when the effect
of the spell ends if the re-roll has not already been used. The
result of the re-roll cannot be changed in any way or re-rolled
again, for example with an Orb of Majesty, Banner of Fortune
or through other means. Likewise the re-roll from this spell
cannot be used to re-roll any dice that another re-roll has
already been used on. Nor can the reroll be used in the case of
a blunder of a command roll, not even mystical foresight can
help avert such mishaps, but it can mitigate the effects, so can
be used to re-roll the dice roll on the blunder chart. For example
if the Norse player rolled for a command needing a roll of a
seven and rolled a five and a three, he could re-roll the dice that
came up as a five, hopefully rolling a four or less making it a
successful command.
+
Only one Eye of the Raven spell may be
in effect per turn.

==== Spite of Low’Key

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Shaman makes a weird enchantment calling the gods to
curse the enemy with bad luck and failure._

All enemy characters within 30cm of the spell caster that roll
a double have those orders count as blunders. This works on
all results, from a double one, to a double five. As a result
all doubles rolled not only blunder, but as with all normal
blunders, it counts as a failed order. The only exception is the
enemy general, as he cannot blunder. The spell lasts until the
end of enemy Command phase.
