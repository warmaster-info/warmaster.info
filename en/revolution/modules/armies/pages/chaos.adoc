The tribes of the northlands are called Marauders by the
civilised folk of the south. Their domain stretches across
the great steppes and throughout the rocky land of Norsca
and encompasses many savage tribes of men. These tribes
can be divided into three main groups – the towering flaxen-
haired Norse, the raven-haired and dark-skinned Kurgan, and
the squat, powerfully built, horse-riding Hung. These peoples
together make up the barbarian hordes of the north whose
incursions to the south comprise the greatest threat to the
civilised nations of the world.

All of these tribes worship the Dark Gods that others call the
gods of Chaos but which the north men know under many
names and in countless guises. Because they live close to the
vast polar source of magic, the influence of magical energy
is especially strong amongst them. Its warping power blows
strongest close to the pole, and the Marauder tribes live within
its domain. When the wind of magic blows hard it brings
mutation and change to the people and their animals, strange
deformed creatures shamble from the darkness, and daemons
walk the land sustained by the magically enriched atmosphere.
When the wind blows strongest all life is corrupted, or
destroyed, and the northern tribes push south in response
driven by what is both the will of the Dark Gods and a howling
storm of magical energy.

Battle is a way of life to the hardy warriors of the northlands.
They share their land with the most heinous of monsters and
when otherwise idle they spend their time fighting each other.
They are tough blood-thirsty barbarians at heart, but they are
also respectful of the gods who, in their eyes, give them their
strength and direct them to glorious conquest. To fight well is to
honour the gods and glorify the tribe. Great warriors are taken
in death to live amongst the gods and are worshipped as gods
themselves. The tribes see themselves as agents of the Dark
Gods, destined to triumph over the lesser people of the south,
to destroy, sacrifice and ultimately to rule in the name of Chaos.

Although it is commonplace for raiding armies to trouble the
lands of Kislev and the northern parts of the Empire, it is rare
for the tribes to act in any cohesive way. When that does happen,
usually due to an extreme outpouring of magical energy from
the north, the whole civilised world is placed in the greatest
peril. This has happened several times in the history of the
world and most notably during what became known as the
Great War against Chaos over two hundred years ago. Only the
sudden and dynamic unification of the Empire and the aid of
the High Elves of Ulthuan saved the human realms of the Old
World at that time, though Kislev was devastated and the city
of Praag destroyed.

== Special rules

{empty}1. Ogres:: If an Ogre unit can use its initiative to charge an enemy
unit of humans at the start of the Command phase then it must
do so. This happens automatically and their commander can
do nothing about it. ‘Humans’ encompasses all ‘men’ including
Chaos Warriors and Marauders, but not Dwarfs, Elves etc.

2. Trolls:: When trying to issue an order to a unit of Trolls or to
a brigade that contains a unit of Trolls, any Command penalty
applied for distance between the character and the Troll unit
is always doubled. So at 20cm no penalty applies, at 40cm −2,
at 60cm −4, and so on. Trolls can regenerate wounds – in each
round of combat after whole stands have been removed Trolls
automatically regenerate one outstanding hit. If no hits are left
over after removing whole stands then regeneration has no
effect. Regenerated hits still count towards the combat result
for the round.

3. Harpies:: Harpies are based facing the long edge of the base in
the same way as infantry, rather than the short edge like other
monsters. Harpies can fly. A unit of harpies cannot be joined
by a character.

4. Dragon Ogres:: Dragon Ogres are immune to terror.

5. Spawn:: Spawn units have −1 Command penalty if not part
of a brigade that includes more non-Spawn units than Spawn
units. Up to two Spawn units can be included in any brigade
and do not count towards the maximum size of that brigade.
+
Spawn units cause terror in combat – enemies suffer the −1
Combat modifier for fighting terrifying creatures. Spawn units
cannot be driven back by shooting and never roll for drive
backs. Spawn units must pursue or advance if victorious in
combat where it is permitted to do so.
+
Spawn units have a shooting range of 15cm and 360° vision –
the unit can draw line of sight from all edges of its stand for
the purpose of evading and shooting, including shooting at
charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs Line of Sight
from its front edge to charge an enemy.

6. Chaos Dragon:: Generals, Wizards and Heroes can ride a
Chaos Dragon. The Chaos Dragon can fly, increasing the rider’s
move from 60 to 100cm, and it adds +3 Attacks to those of its
rider. In addition the Dragon has a special shooting attack. It
can breathe fire. This special attack can only be used if the
rider has joined a unit and is not engaged in combat. A rider
that has not joined a unit cannot use the Dragon’s fiery breath
to attack. The Dragon’s fire breath works as follows. The fire
breath has a range of 20cm. It can be directed against one target
as normal and has 3 Attacks worked out in the usual way. The
Chaos Dragon is a large terrifying creature. A unit that has
been joined by a Chaos Dragon causes terror in its enemies and
therefore imposes the usual Combat penalty.

7. Chariot Mount:: Generals, Sorcerers and Heroes can ride
Chariots. An extra +1 Attack is added to those of its rider.

=== Chaos spells

==== Boon of Chaos

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_A dark power billows from the Sorcerer filling his troops with
the destructive vigour of chaos._

This spell can be cast if the Sorcerer has joined a unit in combat.
The spell affects the unit he has joined. The effect lasts for the
duration of the following Combat phase.

Every stand in the unit, including characters that have joined
the unit, adds +1 to its Attacks value. As the Sorcerer must join
the unit to cast the spell this includes the Sorcerer himself, but
it is possible for other characters to join the unit as well, in
which case the +1 is applied to whichever character fights.

==== Anger of the Gods

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The anger of the chaos gods blots out the sun and sends clouds
of rage scudding across the battlefield all around the Sorcerer._

The spell is cast upon the Sorcerer himself and affects all enemy
units within 30cm of the stand.

The spell lasts until the end of the opposing player’s following
turn.

The spell affects the opposing army’s ability to issue commands.
All enemy units within 30cm of the Chaos Sorcerer suffer a −1
Command penalty. This penalty is applied when each order is
issued: a unit might therefore be within 30cm of the Sorcerer
for one order but not for a second, for example.

==== Rage of Chaos

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Sorcerer screams a blasphemous litany to his dark gods.
From the black gore that drenches the battlefield leaps a roaring
daemonic shadow that fights with great madness and ferocity._

This spell can be cast upon a friendly unit that is engaged in
combat and which is within range. The Sorcerer does not have
to be able to see the target to cast the spell.

The affect lasts for the duration of the following combat phase
and the indicated bonus attacks are added to the unit’s total
attacks each round.

// – changed to ,
The unit gains bonus Rage of Chaos attacks for the following
combat phase. To determine the number of bonus attacks roll
one D6 at a time and add the results together. The player can
roll as many D6 as he wishes up to a maximum of 1 per stand
in the unit. The player always rolls one dice at a time and
can decide to stop at any point. However, if the player rolls
a second or subsequent dice and scores the same value as any
previously rolled dice, then the total Rage of Chaos attacks are
directed against the targeted unit instead of its enemy. Rage of
Chaos attacks that rebound in this way are struck only once in
the first round of combat: they are not struck each round.

// Spacing around + fixed.
Example, 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 extra attacks for the Chaos unit each
round. 1 + 4 + 1 = 6 Attacks upon the Chaos unit in the first round.

==== Curse of Chaos

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

An arc of pure energy strikes the foe, wreaking monstrous
changes, melting flesh and twisting bones into monstrous form.
This spell can be cast on an enemy unit. The Sorcerer must
be able to see his target to use this spell. The spell cannot be
directed at a unit engaged in combat.

The Curse of Chaos is treated like three ordinary shooting
attacks except that armour has no effect (all targets count as
having no armour). A unit can be driven back by a Curse of
Chaos as with ordinary shooting.
