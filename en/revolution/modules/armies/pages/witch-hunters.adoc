Witch Hunters are some of the most characterful and
interesting aspects of the Empire. While it’s true to say
they invariably fight for the greater good of humanity, their
methods are often brutal and arguably little better than those
of their enemies. A Witch Hunter knows that evil doesn’t play
by the rules however, and that to beat it, he must be just as
underhand. If a few innocents get killed in the process, then
it’s regrettable but better than allowing a heretic or warlock to
escape punishment.

Often, Witch Hunters prefer to work alone or in small
groups, such as during the scouring of Mordheim years ago.
Occasionally though there will be need to gather together
under one banner to drive out some great, dark army. Probably
the two most famous times were during the last Great Chaos
Incursion, when a Witch Hunter army was lead by Magnus
the Pious; and during the Wars of the Vampire Counts, when
the whole Empire united to defend itself against the armies of
Vlad and Mannfred Von Carstein. At times like these, Witch
Hunters stir up support from the mobs, and priests take up
the hammer, leading their congregation to defend the lands.
Flagellants seem drawn to these gatherings like flies, preaching
damnation and hellfire almost as loudly as the Witch Hunters
themselves.

Of course, it does not take a desperate situation such as a Chaos
incursion to cause this. Quite often, a Witch Hunter will find
need to gather a force to eradicate a tribe of beastmen in a
surrounding forest, or cast out a Necrarch from a dark tower
in the mountains. If the local noble has not the time, or more
likely the inclination, it calls to a Witch Hunter to deal with
it. He may have some aid in the form of the town watch or
soldiers of the merchants guild, or even a detachment of one of
the Knightly Orders, but often this is not the case.
A Witch Hunter’s army is a rag-tag sight. The black garbed
Zealots of the Witch Hunters’ guild stand shoulder-to-
shoulder with peasants and hastily gathered watchmen. Packs
of Warhounds, equally trained to seek out the scent of the
Undead or a heretic, follow baying and howling. Occasionally
a regiment of Knights marches ahead, their bright armour
contrasts to the rags of the army’s bulk. Priests continue their
sermons on the battlefield, encouraging their followers to acts
of insane bravery, while frothing Flagellants whip themselves
for the sins they may have committed.

== Special rules

=== Army rules

// Add the, the
Some unit’s abilities from Witch Hunter army will affect ‘Chaos
and/or Undead’. ‘Chaos’ means the Chaos army, Daemons army,
Beastmen army, Chaos Dwarf army and Skaven army. ‘Undead’
means the Tomb Kings army and Vampire Counts army
(including units of Ghouls!).

=== Special rules

////
2: + moved
3: they'll → Flagellants
////
{empty}1. Zealots:: Zealots form the main part of a Witch Hunter army,
and are drawn from mobs whipped up by priest’s sermons.
These troops gain +1 Attack in the first round of combat
against Undead or Chaos (regardless of who charged) and will
always use their initiative to charge these enemies if possible. If
victorious in combat with Undead or Chaos like enemies they
must pursue or advance where possible.

2. Handgunners:: Count enemy Armour values as one worse
than normal when shot by a handgun. So an armour value of 3+
counts as 4+, 4+ as 5+, and 5+ as 6+, whilst an Armour value of
6+ can’t save against a handgun.

3. Flagellants:: So keen are they to meet their maker that a unit
of Flagellants will always use its initiative to charge an enemy
if possible and can’t be given orders instead. Flagellants never use
their initiative to evade. They can’t be driven back by shooting
and do not roll for drive backs. If victorious in combat they must
pursue or advance where possible. Flagellants are unaffected
by enemies that cause terror in combat, so they do not suffer
the usual −1 Attack modifier.

4. Warhounds:: Warhound stands are not deployed as
independent units. Instead, any infantry unit may add one
stand of Warhounds. This brings the size of the unit to 4 stands;
3 regular stands plus the Warhound stand. Warhounds always
have the same Armour value as the rest of their unit. They fight
as part of their unit and can be removed as a unit casualty if the
player wishes.
+
Warhound casualties never count for Command penalties.
+
Warhound stands never cause the parent unit to be in Irregular
Formation no matter how they are placed. An Infantry unit
containing a Warhound stand gains the ability to pursue
Cavalry and Chariots.

5. Pistoliers:: Pistoliers have a shooting range of only 15cm and
360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line of sight from
all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting, including
shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs
Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

6. Cannons:: See the rules for xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#cannons[Cannons]
in the Warmaster Rulebook.

=== Witch Hunter spells

==== Sanctuary

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_The Warrior Priest consecrates the ground before the troops,
warding off evil._

The Wizard must be with the unit to affect it. The unit counts
as being defended, even if in the open. If the unit is already
defended, it counts as fortified. Note that this also affects
Cavalry units, even though they are not normally able to receive
this bonus. The effect lasts until the unit moves or Priest leaves
it or he casts another spell.

==== Doctrine of Sigmar

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Through the rousting speech of Sigmar’s chosen, troops are
directed across the field of battle._

The spell can be cast on any unengaged friendly unit within
range regardless of whether the Priest can see it or not. The
spell affects only a single unit, never a brigade and there is no
supporting charge possible.

The unit can be moved just as if it had received an order in the
Command phase. Character stands that have joined the unit
will not move with it: they remain where they are.

==== Holy Fervour

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_Enraged by their blasphemous enemies the troops rush forward
thirsty for blood._

The Wizard must be with the unit to affect it. If successfully
cast on a friendly unit, each stand including character stands
gains +1 Attack during the following Combat phase.

==== Divine Curse

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Speaking the words of Magnus the Pious himself, the Warrior
Priest smites his foes._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the Priest can see it or not. The spell lasts until the
end of the opposing player‘s following turn.

The unit moves at half pace in all situations: even when charging
for example. The unit counts all enemies as terrifying (−1 Attack
penalty) even when it is otherwise immune to terror. If the unit
would normally cause terror then it ceases to do so and counts
all enemies as terrifying just like everyone else. However,
if the target is Undead or Daemon it will not count enemies
as terrifying although all other penalties apply as described
(Undead and Daemons are hard to spook).
