// Aeon is the British spelling

Aeons ago, the Isle of Albion was the site of a sprawling
techo-arcane complex created by an unspeakably ancient
spacefaring race called the Slann. Their carefully aligned stone
circles and thousands of miles of impressively taut laylines once
served to harness the mysterious psychomagical power of the
warp. This power was used to control the gigantic interspatial
portals through which Slann craft traversed the galaxy. At some
time there was an unfortunate accident; the portals became
unstable, opening a rift into the void and creating the zone
of contamination and temporal instability that is now known
as the Chaos Wastes. In order to stop their damaged portals
running out of control and engulfing the entire world, the
Slann destroyed or disabled their control complex on Albion.
A vast quantity of dangerous psycho-active energy was released
as a result.

// Removed "the isle of"
This catastrophe turned Albion into a warped
land that was ever afterwards shrouded by chilling mists
and ceaseless drizzle. The explosive release of warp energy
had the effect of distorting local time and space in surprising
ways. As a result, the island proved almost impossible to find
afterwards and many Old Worlders came to doubt its very
existence. Isolated from the world and from reality, the island’s
inhabitants degenerated physically and culturally, coming
to live an ape-like existence alongside the other malformed
monsters of their devastated land.

// Moved "centre of the"
Despite this, they still retain some vestigial memory of a time
of greatness when their ancestors helped build the
stone circles and other wonders that once formed the nerve
centre of the
Slanns’ techo-arcane warp mechanism.

// mist-wreathed, remove "of Albion", extra .
The mist-wreathed isle has seen as much bloodshed
and warfare as the rest of the known world. Albion is seen as
a damp, bog-ridden backwater and reports of recent incursions
have concentrated on the clashes between the supposedly
more advanced invaders. However, a closer examination of the
campaigns in Albion show that its native armies are every bit
as lethal as those of any of the more so called ‘civilised’ nations.

The core of any Albion army comprises nobles in chariots and
warbands of warriors on foot, screened by youths armed with
slings and javelins led by the local chieftain. Poorer nobles and
richer warriors are mounted on hardy native ponies and form
the cavalry used to both scout and to support the noble chariot
warriors.

Albion is famed for the great wolfhounds the natives breed.
They are exported widely, but most especially to Bretonnia and
the Empire where their size, strength and ferocity are much
prized by noble huntsmen. In times of war these wolfhounds are
gathered into huge slavering packs and are used to supplement
the cavalry, screening attacks and harassing vulnerable enemy
flanks.

In time of war some Chieftains can also call on the giant eagles
whose eyries dot the highest peaks of the land. Few of Albion’s
chieftains will pass up the chance to recruit some of their
island’s largest inhabitants – the famed giants of Albion. Just
like those giants that accompany Orc armies, these massive
warriors make up for in brawn what they lack in brains!

Not quite so strong, but then again not quite so dim, are the
bands of ogres which flock to join the armies of Albion – for a
share of the loot and the chance to turn a former enemy into a
quick snack! In addition to the warrior chieftains who lead the
armies, there are heroic warriors who help to marshal the army
and the enigmatic druids who are not only the army’s wizards
but also its law makers, judges and soothsayers.

== Special rules

////
4: Minor rewording.
6: cannot.  Reworded to favour singular as it's an individual monster
6: Unclear, that specific druid or all druids?  Changed to "that Druid" as I think that's the intention
////
{empty}1. Ogres:: If an Ogre unit can use its initiative to charge an enemy
unit of humans at the start of the Command phase then it must
do so. This happens automatically and their commander can
do nothing about it. ‘Humans‘ encompasses all ‘men‘ including
Chaos Warriors and Marauders, but not Dwarfs, Elves etc.

2. Giant::
include::partial$giant.adoc[]

3. Giant Eagle:: Giant Eagles can fly.

4. Giant Eagle Mount:: Giant Eagles can be ridden only by Druids
An Eagle can fly, increasing its rider’s move from 60 to
100cm, and it adds +2 Attacks to those of its rider.

5. Chariot Mount:: Generals, Druids and Heroes can ride
Chariots. An extra +1 Attack is added to those of its rider.

6. Fenbeast:: A Fenbeast is an individual troop unit, but it is not
fielded in the standard way. Fenbeasts
appear on the battlefield only after a Druid casts the Summon
Fenbeast spell.
+
A Fenbeast cannot be brigaded with other troop units, not even
other Fenbeasts. Fenbeasts never use their initiative to move in
the Command phase. Because they are completely dominated
by the will of the Druid who summoned them, that Druid
counts as having a Command value of +1 when commanding
the Fenbeast – that is 8 rather than 7.
+
Fenbeast can move through
bogs as though they were open terrain. Unlike the wild Bog
Beasts from the ‘Dark Shadows’ campaign, Fenbeast will make
way for friendly troops.
+
A Fenbeast causes terror in its enemies.

=== Albion spells

==== Downpour

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Druid brings down a localised shower of fine, freezing rain
upon his foes._

Until the start of the Druid player’s next turn all enemy units
within 30cms of the casting Druid suffer -1 to their command.

==== Storm of Hail

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Druid harnesses the power of the weather to attack his
enemies with enormous hailstones._

The Druid targets a single enemy unit within range and that he
can see. This has the effect of three shooting attacks except that
it ignores any armour save the target may have. The target unit
may be driven back in the same way as for shooting.

==== Mists of Albion

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Druid breathes out some of the mystical mist that surrounds
his enigmatic homeland and envelopes his compatriots, making
them hard to target by enemy troops._

This spell may be cast upon a single unengaged friendly
Infantry unit within range, regardless of whether the caster
can see them or not. The spell lasts until the start of the caster‘s
next turn, or until the target unit moves in any way. The target
Infantry unit counts as Defended, even if in the open terrain.

==== Summon Fenbeast

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Druid performs one of the most arcane rituals known to
his order, using his power over the elements to bind together
the horrific creature known as the Fenbeast._

The Druid summons forth a Fenbeast. Once summoned, the
Fenbeast is under the control of the summoning player.

Since it is summoned in the Shooting phase it cannot be given
orders until the following turn. It may be summoned into contact
with an enemy unit only if that unit is already in combat. It may
be removed from play if destroyed (like any other unit) or if the
loss of a Druid character reduces the number of Druids to less
than the number of Fenbeasts – the owning player chooses a
Fenbeast and removes it from play.

// Summoned
Summoned Fenbeast units
do not influence army withdrawal calculations in any way
and do not have a points value.

// Paragraphs added.
Fenbeasts may only be given
orders by Druids. Fenbeasts may not be brigaded with other
troops, not even other Fenbeasts. An army cannot have more
summoned Fenbeasts in play than it has Druids.
