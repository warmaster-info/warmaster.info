The Empire is by far the largest and most powerful of the
human nations of the Old World. It stretches from the
Grey Mountains in the west to the Worlds Edge Mountains
and the borders of Kislev in the east. This vast nation is divided
into many separate principalities or states each of which is
something akin to an entire and independent land in its own
right. Throughout much of the history of The Empire these
states have fought amongst themselves. Rival dynasties have
vied for power, alliances have been made and broken, and only
rarely has a single claimant risen to control the entire land. The
Empire of today is almost wholly united under the Prince of
Altdorf the Elector of the Reikland – hereditary ruler of the
western principality of the Reikland. Only the great sea-port of
Marienburg in the Wasteland retains independence under the
leadership of its powerful and wealthy mercantile community.

The armies of The Empire are raised and controlled by its
separate states. The Emperor‘s army is nothing more than the
army of the Reikland – although as the Reikland is the richest
and most populous part of the Empire it also has by far the
largest and best equipped army.

The Emperor‘s position is that of first amongst equals rather
than absolute monarch. Although in practice rule of the
Empire often passes from father to son, in principle the leaders
of the various states choose the Emperor from amongst their
own number. The Emperor can, in theory, call upon the other
Electors to supply troops for the Emperor‘s campaigns. By the
same token, individual Electors can call upon the Emperor
or neighbouring states to send reinforcements in times of
war. Jealousy, rivalry and politicking mean that some states
inevitably support or oppose others. Minor territorial disputes
or claims over tolls and access rights often lead to direct
confrontation even with the Empire.

The armies of the Empire are committed to defending its
borders and rarely mount lengthy campaigns beyond them.
A long standing alliance between the Emperor and the Tzars
of Kislev has occasionally taken armies far to the north to
fight against intrusions of Chaos. Such armies do not always
return. The chief enemies of the Empire lay within its own
borders – for the land is sparsely settled and much of the forest
and mountain is little more than wilderness infested with
greenskins and beastmen. The mountains to the south and
east are also home to subterranean living goblins as well as to
skaven. Those states that adjoin these borderlands maintain
large mobile armies to see off the inevitable raiding parties that
issue from the mountain passes every spring.

== Special rules

////
3: – changed to :
////

{empty}1. Handgunners:: Count enemy Armour values as one worse
than normal when shot by a handgun. So an Armour value of 3+
counts as 4+, 4+ as 5+, and 5+ as 6+, whilst an Armour value of
6+ can’t save against a handgun. One unit of Crossbowmen per
full 1000 points can be replaced by Handgunners (including the
10pts extra in price) while still counting for the Crossbowmen
min/max value. Note that this unit also counts for min/max
value of Handgunners.

2. Flagellants:: So keen are they to meet their maker that a unit
of Flagellants will always use its initiative to charge an enemy
if possible and can’t be given orders instead. They‘ll never use
their initiative to evade. They can’t be driven back by shooting
and do not roll for drive backs. If victorious in combat they must
pursue or advance where possible. Flagellants are unaffected
by enemies that cause terror in combat, so they do not suffer
the usual −1 Attack modifier.

3. Skirmishers:: Skirmisher stands are not deployed as
independent units. Instead, any infantry unit apart from
Flagellants may add one stand of Skirmishers. This brings the
size of the unit to 4 stands: 3 regular stands plus the Skirmisher
stand.
+
Skirmishers always have the same Armour value as the rest of
their unit. They fight as part of their unit and can be removed
as a unit casualty if the player wishes.
+
Skirmisher casualties never count for Command penalties.
Skirmisher stands never cause the parent unit to be in Irregular
Formation no matter how they are placed.

4. Pistoliers:: Pistoliers have a shooting range of only 15cm
however they have 360° vision – i.e. stands in this unit can
draw line of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading
and shooting, including shooting at charging enemies. Note that
this unit still needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge
an enemy.

5. Helblaster:: The Helblaster is a primitive type of crankdriven
and unreliable machine gun. It has maximum range of 30cm. Its
attacks value varies according to range: the closer the range the
more deadly it becomes.
+
[cols="<,3*^",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
h|Range  |1–10cm |11–20cm |21–30cm
h|Attack |8      |4       |2
|===
+
Targets struck by a Helblaster count their Armour value as one
worse than normal – so 3+ counts as 4+, 4+ as 5+, whilst 6+ is
ignored. When shooting with a Helblaster roll to hit as normal
but if any 1s are rolled count them up and resolve the effect
before counting.
+
[cols="^1,6",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
|№ of 1s |Result

h|1, 2
|*Fizzle.* Despite scary noises the weapon is still
functional. Work out the attacks as usual.

h|3
|*Misfire.* The gun fails to go off – no shots at all hit this
turn. Disregard all hits this turn.

h|4
|*Ka-boom!* The weapon explodes destroying itself and
mortally surprising its crew. The Helblaster stand is
removed as a casualty. No hits are struck against the
enemy unless the exploding Helblaster is shooting at
a charging foe, in which case 6 hits are automatically
inflicted. Make Armour saves as for ordinary
Helblaster hits.
|===

6. Steam Tank:: The Steam Tank forms a unit on its own, it
moves up to 20cm, and must be given its own orders. The Steam
Tank cannot be given a brigade order with other units, not even
with other Steams Tanks. A character cannot join with a Steam
Tank. A Steam Tank has 360° vision – i.e. it can draw line of
sight from all edges of its stand for the purpose of evading and
shooting, including shooting at charging enemies. Note that this
unit still needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an
enemy. Steam Tank shooting attacks have a range of 30cm. A
Steam Tank therefore shoots to its front, side or rear against the
closest enemy target.
+
Count enemy armour values as one worse than normal when
shot by a Steam Tank. So, for example, an armour value of 3+
counts as 4+, 5+ counts as 6+, and 6+ can’t save against a Steam
Tank. A Steam Tank can shoot at charging enemy.
+
Because of its exceptionally heavy armour plating, a Steam Tank
always counts as defended – so a 5 or 6 is normally required to
inflict a hit from shooting or in combat. The Steam Tank fights
combat like any other unit. Steam Tanks cannot be driven back
or routed by shooting.
+
If the player attempts to issue an order to a Steam Tank and
rolls double six then the order is failed as usual and the machine
does not move. Ignore the usual Blunder chart for heroes
and wizards. Roll on the following Malfunction chart. Note
that although a General cannot blunder he must still roll for
malfunctions.
+
[cols="^1,6",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
h|1
|*Destroyed.* The Steam Tank grinds to a halt rupturing
steam and noxious gasses. Remove the Steam Tank as
a casualty.

h|2
|*Broken Down.* The Steam Tank‘s drive has broken. It
does not move further this turn and cannot move in
future turns. Should it be obliged to move for any
reason it is destroyed. Otherwise, the Steam Tank can
continue to shoot and fight as normal.

h|3
|*Stuck.* The Steam tank does not move further this
turn. It cannot shoot this turn. Otherwise it is
unaffected and can move in future turns as normal.

h|4
|*Commander Slain.* The Steam Tank does not move
further this turn. It can move in future turns but
suffers a command penalty of −1 for the remainder of
the game. The Steam Tank can shoot as normal.
Momentary Halt. The Steam Tank cannot move
further this turn but is otherwise unaffected.
Steam Overload. The Steam Tank cannot move
further this turn but can shoot with double the usual
number of Attacks (6) to represent steam being
uncontrollably diverted into weaponry.
|===

7. Griffons:: Generals, Wizards and Heroes can ride Griffons.
The Griffon can fly increasing its rider‘s Movement from 60cm
to 100cm. It adds +2 Attacks to those of its rider. A unit that
includes a Griffon rider causes terror in its enemies (and one
might imagine a great deal of nervousness amongst its own
ranks).

8. War Altar:: There is only one War Altar of Sigmar.
Consequently an army, no matter how large, can only ever
include one. A War Altar can only be included as a mount for a
Wizard, in which case he is assumed to be the Grand Theogonist.
The presence of the War Altar adds +1 Attack and enables the
Grand Theogonist to add +1 to the dice result when casting a
spell once during the battle. The player must announce that he
is using the power of the War Altar before rolling the dice for
the spell.

=== Empire spells

==== Ball of Flame

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A ball of flame shoots form the Wizard‘s outstretched arm
burning all in its path._

Draw an imaginary line 30cm long from the Wizard‘s stand
in any direction you wish. The line will pass through any
intervening units but not beyond terrain that would normally
stop a missile shot, e.g. over the crest of a hill, more than 2cm of
woodland, and so forth.

Each unit under the line takes three shooting attacks worked
out in the usual way. Note that this spell can easily affect
several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line
(including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back
by a Ball of Flame as with ordinary shooting (even including
friends). Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Ball of
Flame but carry over any hits scored into the first round of
combat; any hits scored count as having been struck in the
combat itself.

==== Voice of Command

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Wizard‘s voice booms out across the battlefield directing
troops above the tumult of combat with the magical Voice of
Command._

The spell can be cast on any unengaged friendly unit within
range regardless of whether the Wizard can see it or not. The
spell affects only a single unit, never a brigade and there is no
supporting charge possible.

The unit can be moved just as if it had received an order in the
Command phase. Character stands that have joined the unit
will not move with it: they remain where they are.

==== Weird Enchantment

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A weird enchantment forms around the target unit and engulfs
it in strange lights, scary nightmares and disorientating special
effects._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the Wizard can see it or not. The spell lasts until the
end of the opposing player‘s following turn.

The unit moves at half pace in all situations: even when charging
for example. The unit counts all enemies as terrifying (−1 Attack
penalty) even when it is otherwise immune to terror. If the unit
would normally cause terror then it ceases to do so and counts
all enemies as terrifying just like everyone else. However,
if the target is Undead or Daemon it will not count enemies
as terrifying although all other penalties apply as described
(Undead and Daemons are hard to spook).

==== Teleport

[.cost]#2+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_With a swirl of his cloak, a crack of thunder and just a hint of
maniacal laughter the Wizard vanishes to reappear anywhere
on the battlefield._

The Wizard is moved to a new position anywhere on the table.
He can leave or join a unit if he wishes, enabling a Wizard
to move into or out of combat for example. Once the Wizard
has moved he can cast a second spell, but note this must be
a different spell and not a further Teleport! Roll to cast the
second spell as normal. A Wizard that Teleports successfully
can therefore potentially cast two spells that turn.
