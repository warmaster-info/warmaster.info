Many thousands of years ago the Dwarf race moved
northwards from its ancestral home somewhere in the
Southlands. They moved along the high ridge of mountains
known as the Worlds Edge Mountains, following the trail of
mineral ores and precious gems.

The Dwarfs spread amongst the mountains, driven onwards
by their lust for the secrets of rock and metal. Over a period
of many hundreds of years they dug shafts and excavated
cavernous underground cities, they sank mines deep into the
mountain roots, and constructed tunnels which carried them
further north.

Eventually, sometime in the dim and distant past, the Dwarfs
reached the upland region at the far north of the Worlds Edge
Mountains which they called Zorn Uzkul or the Great Skull
Land. Here they found a vast and inhospitable plateau where
the air was thin and cold and the rocks barren. Many turned
back south to swell the growing numbers of Dwarfs in the
Worlds Edge Mountains, others turned west into the cold lands
of Norsca, but some of the most adventurous turned east and
then south along the bleak Mountains of Mourn.

At first these widespread Dwarf kindreds maintained contact
with each other, but the eastern Dwarfs strayed far and when
the Time of Chaos came the northern regions were cut off
forever. The Dwarfs of the west believed their eastern kin
dead, destroyed by the tides of Chaos that came from the north,
but they were mistaken. Chaos did not kill the hardy Dwarfs,
instead it worked a dreadful change upon them.

The Chaos Dwarf Empire is sited amidst the Mountains of
Mourn and the adjoining eastern part of the Dark Lands. It is
a stark and cheerless place, where nature has rent the ground
and burst the mountains apart. It is a land rich in the materials
that Dwarfs especially covet.

It is impossible to say for certain how or when the Dwarf
kindred of the east became the Chaos Dwarfs. Probably it was a
slow process of warping and twisting, for Dwarfs are stubborn
by nature and more resistant to magic than other creatures.
Nonetheless they were changed.

Their Dwarf instincts became perverted into a mockery of
traditional values. The huge and monstrous Tower of Zharr-Naggrund,
the City of Fire and Desolation, arose on the plain of
Zharrduk. This monstrous city is fashioned from black obsidian
and stained with the red glow of a thousand diabolic furnaces.
Where Dwarfs shun magic the Chaos Dwarfs embraced it and
became mighty sorcerers, the creators of arcane machineries
and horrific engines.

The refuse of thousands of years of labour fills the Plain of
Zharrduk where industry tears at the earth, pock-marking the
surface with ugly scars of endeavour. Beneath the flickering
flames of countless forges untold thousands of slaves, creatures
of many races captured in war or traded from the Orcs of the
west, work at the enterprises of the Chaos Dwarfs.

== Special rules

////
1: "The unit has 2 shooting attacks" — not each stand? TODO clarify.
2: its, brigade grammar
4: this → either
5: is treated as, this → either, past → beyond
////
{empty}1. Blunderbusses:: Units with Blunderbusses have a shooting
range of 15cm. The unit has 2 shooting attacks. Units hit by
Blunderbusses get a -1 penalty for their armour rolls. One
unit of Blunderbusses per full 1000 points can replace a unit
of Warriors while still counting for the Chaos Dwarfs min/
max value. Note that this unit still counts for max value of
Blunderbusses.

2. Hobgoblins:: Hobgoblins and Hobgoblin Wolf Riders carry
an assortment of smaller ranged arms, so may only shoot up
to 15cm and have 360° vision - stands in this unit can draw
line of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading and
shooting, including shooting at charging enemies. Note that
this unit still needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge
an enemy. Hobgoblins and Orcs have a strong hatred so units
of Hobgoblins or Hobgoblin Wolf Riders may not brigade
with units of Black Orcs or Orc Slaves unless Chaos Dwarfs or
Blunderbusses are part of the brigade.

3. Orc Slaves:: Slaves are just that, captives forced to work and
fight for their cruel masters’ enjoyment. A unit of Slaves suffer
an additional -1 Command penalty when given an order. This
penalty is waived, however, if the Slaves are brigaded with
Black Orcs, Chaos Dwarfs or Blunderbusses.

4. Earthshaker Cannon:: The Earthshaker acts as a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#stone-thrower[Stone
Thrower] as described in the Rulebook. The exception is
that the drive back from the Eartshaker shot causes confusion on
rolls of 4+ rather than the usual 6+. In addition the Earthshaker
shot causes confusion in units in base contact with the victim
unit on rolls of 6 on a D6 (roll for each unit).
+
The total number
of Earthshakers and Death Rockets in the army is limited in the
way that only 1 piece of either kind is allowed per 1000 points.

5. Death Rocket:: The Death Rocket acts is treated as a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#stone-thrower[Stone
Thrower] as described in the Rulebook, except it shoots
1D6 times per phase and hits inflicted on the target can be
still saved by armour with a -1 modifier. If the roll for the
number of shots is 1, the Death Rocket has misfired
and you must roll a dice against the Death Rocket Misfire chart.
+
The total number of Earthshakers and Death Rockets in the
army is limited in the way that only 1 piece of either kind is
allowed per 1000 points.

h|1
|*KABOOM!* The Death Rocket explodes in
spectacular manner.

h|2-3
|*Dud.* The rocket does only one attack.

|*Whoosh!* The rocket overshoots and does D6
attacks on the first unit in the line of fire
beyond the original target, regardless of range.
If the result is 1, don‘t roll for the misfire
again. If the target is engaged in combat, the
hits are carried over into Combat phase. If
no target is behind the victim the rocket
leaves the battlefield without causing any
damage.

h|6
|*Big badaboom!* The rocket does 2D6 attacks
instead of the normal 1D6.

6. Bolt Thrower:: The Hobgoblin Bolt Thrower is a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#bolt-thrower[Bolt Thrower]
as described in main Rulebook.

7. Great Taurus:: Any character may be mounted on a Great
Taurus. This mighty beast is fearsome to face on the battlefield.
The Great Taurus causes terror and is able to fly.

8. Lammasu:: The Lammasu is a magical creature trained to
serve the Chaos Dwarfs. A Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer may be
mounted on a Lammasu. A Lammasu is able to fly.
+
In addition
once per turn you can attempt to dispel one hostile spell cast on
one friendly unit within 30cm of the Lammasu on a roll of 4+ on
a D6. There can only be one Lammasu in the army.

9. Sorcerer Lord:: The General may be true Sorcerer Lord,
maybe even one of the living ancestors from Zharr-Naggrund.
Sorcerer Lord can cast spells like a Wizard and can carry a
magic item restricted to a Wizard if desired. Once during the
battle Sorcerer Lord can add +1 to the dice when attempting
to cast a spell. The player must announce that the Sorcerer’s
special spell casting bonus is being used before rolling for the
spell.

_The Sorcerer’s hand glows like molten steel as he calls forth the
strength of the forges of the earth._

This can only be cast if the Sorcerer has joined a unit in combat.
The spell automatically makes three attacks on one enemy unit
which is touching the unit the Sorcerer has joined. These are
worked out in the usual way. Any hits scored are carried over
into the first round of combat and count as having been struck
in combat.

==== Volcanic Eruption

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Sorcerer‘s calls forth a storm of magma from beneath the
earth._

Each enemy unit within 30cm of the Sorcerer’s stand takes 3
Attacks worked out in the normal way. A unit is not driven
back by the Volcanic Eruption. Engaged units carry over any
hits scored into the first round of combat and hits caused by the
Volcanic Eruption count as having been struck in the combat
itself.

==== Word of Fear

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

// instils
_The Sorcerer speaks a blasphemous litany that instils fear in
the hearts of his enemies._

This spell can only be cast on any friendly unit within range
regardless of whether the Sorcerer can see it or not. The unit
counts as causing terror for the duration of the Combat phase.

==== Meteor Storm

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Sorcerer hurls flaming stones from his fingertips toward
the enemy, battering everything in its path._

// scored
Draw an imaginary line 30cm long extending from the
Sorcerer’s stand in any direction you wish. Each unit under
the line takes three shooting attacks worked out in the usual
way. Note that this spell can easily affect several units and will
affect all units that fall beneath its path, including your own.
Unengaged units can be driven back by the Meteor Storm as
with ordinary shooting. Engaged units cannot be driven back,
but carry over any hits that are scored into the first round of
combat. Hits caused by the Meteor Storm count as having been
struck in the combat itself.
