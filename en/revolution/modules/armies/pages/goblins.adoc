Goblins are small, green, vicious, mean-spirited and generally
unpleasant creatures. Clues as to their character may
be discerned in their tiny pointed teeth, beady glinting eyes,
scrawny grasping hands and general demeanour of a whipped
dog.

To give them their due, Goblins are prolific. There are lots
of them and no matter how many die or run away, there are
always plenty left. Their preferred method of fighting is to
shoot their enemy in the back from a good distance. They
are half-way decent shots but in other respects are poor and
often unwilling fighters. However, they are dangerous in large
numbers and quite capable of overwhelming far better troops
by sheer weight of numbers.

Like all greenskins, Goblins are quarrelsome and fractious.
They fight amongst themselves both on and off the battlefield.
They feel little sense of loyalty to their own kind let alone
anyone else, and will cheerfully maim, kill and even eat their
comrades if they can get away with it.

Goblins are generally recognised as belonging to two main
breeds, namely Common Goblins and Night Goblins. These
types are not physically different to each other, although all
kinds of Goblin are liable to extreme variations in size, so it is
quite usual for a mob of Goblins to include some individuals as
much as twice the size of others. In this respect, where a big
Snotling becomes a Goblin and vice versa is debatable, though
from an Orc’s point of view it hardly matters as they’re all there
to be bossed about.

The majority of Goblins living in open areas, most notably in
the Badlands and Dark Lands, are Common Goblins or just
ordinary Gobbos. They are as common as muck throughout
the hills, valleys and plains of the Old World and beyond. We
quite cheerfully refer to all the different kinds of Goblins as
Goblins, but where this might prove confusing we call ordinary
Common Goblins just that ... Common Goblins. And ain’t they
just!

Common Goblins ride Giant Wolves much as humans ride
horses. Not only are these large and dangerous creatures ridden
by individual Goblins, but chariots and carts may be pulled by
several Giant Wolves harnessed together. Giant Wolves are
vicious creatures with slavering fangs and sharp claws, quite
often more dangerous than their Goblin riders. They are faster
than horses too.

Goblin Wolf Riders commonly raid and pillage ahead of
advancing Goblin hordes, scouring the countryside for signs
of enemy troop movements. On the battlefield they harry the
flanks of enemy units and chase down those who’ve fled braver
greenskins.

Night Goblins are adapted to life underground where they
subsist on fungi, cave squigs, beetles and bits of each other.
They live under the mountains throughout the Old World and
Southlands in tunnels and caverns that are cool and dark. Night
Goblins have a strong aversion to daylight and when forced
above ground wear black or very dark enveloping robes to
protect themselves from the sun’s rays.

== Special rules

////
1: Squig Herds
2: Paragraph added
3: its
4: "it charges, pursuits or advances," seem extra TODO
   Reworded anyway.

////

{empty}1. Goblins:: A Goblin unit is allowed to shoot as if it had bows
but its range is reduced to 15cm. Up to two units per full 1000
points can be replaced by Squig Herds while still counting for
the Goblin min/max value. Note that these units still count for
min/max value of Squig Herds.

2. Trolls:: When trying to issue an order to a unit of Trolls or to
a brigade that contains a unit of Trolls, any Command penalty
applied for distance between the character and the Troll unit
is always doubled. So at 20cm no penalty applies, at 40cm −2,
at 60cm −4, and so on.
+
Trolls can regenerate wounds – in each
round of combat after whole stands have been removed Trolls
automatically regenerate one outstanding hit. If no hits are left
over after removing whole stands then regeneration has no
effect. Regenerated hits still count towards the combat result
for the round.

3. Wolf Riders:: The Wolf Riders have a shooting range of 15cm
and 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line of sight from
all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting, including
shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs
Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

4. Pump Wagon:: The Pump Wagon doesn’t move in Command
phase by initiative or by successful orders. Instead of this it can
always move once up to 1D6 x 10cm. This move is automatic,
requiring no Command roll, and happens at any time during
the Command phase but may not interrupt a character giving
orders or units moving (including other Pump Wagons). This
gives the Pump Wagon a movement of between 10cm and 60cm
each turn.
+
In the combat round a
Pump Wagon receives D6 attacks. This is in addition to any
additional attacks it receives for charging enemy in the open
and for being a chariot. When charged or after retreating as a result
of combat, its attacks are halved to D3. Roll to determine
the number of attacks an every round of combat.
+
A Pump Wagon cannot be driven back by shooting and does not
roll for drive backs. Pump Wagons ignore confusion. A Pump
Wagon cannot be brigaded with other units; not even another
Pump Wagons, and characters cannot join it. The enemy does
not gain Victory points for a destroyed Pump Wagon and a
Pump Wagon does not count towards the Goblin army’s break
value in any way.

5. Giant::
include::partial$giant.adoc

6. Doom Diver:: The Doom Diver has a range of 60cm and a unit
hit by a Doom Diver is allowed to make its normal armour save.
Doom Divers shoot at such a high trajectory that they cannot
shoot at charging enemies.

7. Spear Chukka:: The Spear Chukka is a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#bolt-thrower[Bolt Thrower].

8. Wolf Chariot:: A General, Hero or Wizard can ride a Wolf
Chariot. The character riding a chariot adds +1 to his Attacks.

9. Wyvern:: Characters may ride Wyverns. A Wyvern can fly
increasing its rider’s movement from 60cm to 100cm, and it
adds +2 Attacks to those of its rider. A unit that includes a
Wyvern rider causes terror in its enemies.

=== Goblin spells

==== Mork Save Uz!

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Shaman summons the power of Mork to protect the
greenskins from the enemy._

This spell can be cast on any friendly unit within 30cm of the
Shaman. The unit gains a 5+ save worked out in the usual
manner until the beginning of their next turn. If the unit
already has a saving roll then it can choose which one to make,
but may not take both.

==== Gerroff!!!

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 60cm#

_The voice of Gork booms out across the battlefield driving back
his foes with a rancid gale force yell._

This spell can be cast on any unengaged enemy unit within
range regardless of whether the Shaman can see it or not. The
spell cannot be cast on a unit engaged in combat.

The enemy unit is driven back 1D6 x 5cm towards its own
table edge. This is treated in the same way as a drive back from
shooting, except that the direction is established by determining
the shortest route to the table edge. A unit cannot be routed by
a drive back from a Gerroff spell. If the unit leaves the table
edge it must roll as described in the main Warmaster rules.

==== Brain Busta

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A fearsome bolt of pure Waaagh! energy issues from the
Shaman’s outstretched hand and strikes an enemy unit._

The Shaman must be able to see his target to use this spell and
it cannot be directed at a unit engaged in combat. Brain Busta is
treated like three ordinary shooting attacks except that armour
saves have no effect (all targets count as having no armour).
A unit can be driven back by Brain Busta as with ordinary
shooting.

==== Waaagh!

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The shaman summons the power of the mighty Waaagh! to
invigorate the greenskins._

This spell can be cast on a friendly unit of Goblins engaged in
combat; including Squig Herds, Wolf Riders, Wolf Chariots and
Pump Wagons but not Trolls, Giants or other non-greenskins.
The spell can be cast regardless of whether the Shaman can see
the target or not.

The spell lasts for the duration of the following Combat phase.
Every stand in the unit, including characters that have joined
the unit, adds +1 to its Attacks value.
