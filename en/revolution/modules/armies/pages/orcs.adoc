Once Orcs ruled the whole of the Old World as well as the
lands far to the east and south. The various tribes fought,
conquered and absorbed each other in one huge glorious battle
that lasted for countless centuries. ‘Countless’ because Orcs
were and remain in a state of uncompromising savagery having
mastered neither writing nor counting beyond three. This
happily blood-thirsty state of affairs lasted until the human
tribes united together with the Dwarfs to drive the Orcs from
the lands west of the Worlds Edge Mountains. Subsequently,
Orc tribes are mostly to be found in the Bad Lands to the south
of the Old World and the Dark Lands to the east. There the
great business of fighting amongst themselves continues to this
day.

Orcs are the largest and most ferocious of the greenskinned
races and they dominate the smaller Goblins and Snotlings
almost completely. Despite this many independent Goblin
tribes continue to live deep in the forests and mountains of
the Old World as well as in the Worlds Edge Mountains and
beyond. These smaller greenskins are far better adapted to life
below ground and in the dense forests because they are smarter
and more nimble-fingered than Orcs. This is why Orc tribes
always include Goblin slaves to make armour and weapons, and
do such practical stuff as Orcs either can’t be bothered with or
just don’t understand. The smallest of these creatures are called
Snotlings, tiny sub-goblins that live amongst and alongside their
larger relatives. They are occasionally pressed to simple tasks
but for the most part they are regarded as pests, treated like
pets, or enthusiastically eaten – for all greenskins are cannibals
though they prefer human flesh when they can get it.

The Orc way of life is war. Every Orc measures his worth by
the number of enemies he has slain – and also the number of
friends, for Orcs fight each other all the time. By fighting they
establish which of them is best and this is reflected in their
curious metabolism. The more dominant an Orc becomes the
bigger he grows so it is always easy to see which Orcs are in
charge and who is boss – just look for the big guy.

All Orcs want to be biggest and best, and the surest way to
achieve this is to follow the biggest Orc and share in his success.
Because the top chieftains are continuously fighting off rivals
their reign does not usually last for very long. Nor is there
any shortage of strong, young Orcs waiting to take a fallen
chieftain’s place. Thus Orc society is a genuine meritocracy
where the best always rise to the top and stay there only so long
as they can fight off the opposition.

There are an untold number of Orc tribes in the world and most
are itinerant, surviving by a process of raiding and despoliation.
If one chieftain proves very successful in this respect other
chieftains will quickly throw in their lot with this up and
coming warlord. A successful warlord’s forces will therefore
grow and will continue to grow until there are so many Orcs in
one place they will either self-destruct in a mighty inter-tribal
war or go on the warpath and invade one of the human lands to
the west. A great invasion of this kind is known as a Waaagh.
The great number of Orcs that make up the Waaagh generates a
kind of unstoppable enthusiasm that sends the greenskins into
a spree of killing and looting that only ends once the leader of
the Waaagh has been slain. Because Orcs understand little or
nothing of concepts such as retreat, consolidation, or holding
territory, it is inevitable that a Waaagh will run out of steam
eventually; the only question is how much destruction can it
cause first.

== Orcs army selector

[%header,format=tsv,role=unit,cols="2*<,8*^",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
include::partial$orcs.tsv[]
|===

== Special rules

{empty}1. Goblins:: A Goblin unit is allowed to shoot as if it had bows
but its range is reduced to 15cm.

2. Trolls:: When trying to issue an order to a unit of Trolls or to
a brigade that contains a unit of Trolls, any Command penalty
applied for distance between the character and the Troll unit
is always doubled. So at 20cm no penalty applies, at 40cm −2,
at 60cm −4, and so on. Trolls can regenerate wounds – in each
round of combat after whole stands have been removed Trolls
automatically regenerate one outstanding hit. If no hits are left
over after removing whole stands then regeneration has no
effect. Regenerated hits still count towards the combat result
for the round.

3. Ogres:: If an Ogre unit can use its initiative to charge an enemy
unit of humans at the start of the Command phase then it must
do so. This happens automatically and their commander can
do nothing about it. ‘Humans’ encompasses all ‘men’ including
Chaos Warriors and Marauders, but not Dwarfs, Elves etc.

4. Wolf Riders:: The Wolf Rider’s range is restricted to 15cm.
Wolf Riders have 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line
of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting,
including shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still
needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

5. Giants::
include::partial$giant.adoc[]

6. Rock Lobber:: Rock Lobber is a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#stone-thrower[Stone Thrower] as described
in the Rulebook.

7. Wyverns:: Generals, Wizards and Heroes can ride Wyverns.
A Wyvern can fly, increasing its rider’s move from 60 to 100cm,
and it adds +2 Attacks to those of its rider. A unit that includes
a Wyvern rider causes terror in its enemies.

8. Chariots:: A General, Wizard or Hero can ride a Chariot. A
character in a chariot adds +1 to his Attacks.

=== Orc spells

==== Foot of Gork

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range 50cm#

_A gigantic spectral green foot descends from the heavens with
a mighty thunk, crushing the enemy to pulp and grinding their
bones into the dirt._

This spell can be cast on any unengaged enemy unit within
range regardless of whether the Shaman can see it or not. The
spell cannot be cast on a unit engaged in combat.

The unit suffers six attacks worked out in the usual way. A unit
cannot be driven back by the Foot of Gork because Gork’s foot
descends from above!.

==== Gotcha

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_With a mighty heave a huge green fist erupts from the Shaman’s
gaping mouth and strikes all within its path._

Draw an imaginary line 30cm long from the Shaman’s stand
in any direction you wish. The line will pass through any
intervening units but not beyond terrain that would normally
stop a missile shot, e.g. over the crest of a hill, more than 2cm of
woodland, and so forth.

Each unit under the line takes three shooting attacks worked
out in the usual way. Note that this spell can easily affect
several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line
(including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back by
a Gotcha as with ordinary shooting (even including friends).
Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Gotcha but carry
over any hits scored into the first round of combat; any hits
scored count as having been struck in the combat itself.

==== Gerroff!!!

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 60cm#

_The voice of Gork booms out across the battlefield driving back
his foes with a rancid gale force yell._

This spell can be cast on any unengaged enemy unit within
range regardless of whether the Shaman can see it or not. The
spell cannot be cast on a unit engaged in combat.

The enemy unit is driven back 1D6 x 5cm towards its own
table edge. This is treated in the same way as a drive back from
shooting, except that the direction is established by determining
the shortest route to the table edge. A unit cannot be routed by
a drive back from a Gerroff spell. If the unit leaves the table
edge it must roll as described in the main Warmaster rules.

==== Waagh!

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The shaman summons the power of the mighty Waaagh! to
invigorate the greenskins._

This spell can be cast on a friendly unit of Orc or Goblins
engaged in combat; including Black Orcs, Wolf Riders, Boar
Boyz and any type of Orc or Goblin troops but not Trolls,
Ogres, Giants or other non-greenskins. The spell can be cast
regardless of whether the Shaman can see the target or not.

The spell lasts for the duration of the following Combat phase.
Every stand in the unit, including characters that have joined
the unit, adds +1 to its Attacks value.
