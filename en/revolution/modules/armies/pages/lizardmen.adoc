Before Chaos came into the world there was a more ancient
forgotten age - the Age of the Old Ones. This far-off time
lies beyond the memory of man and is recalled only dimly by
the Elves - the most ancient of all the world‘s warm-blooded
races. In that distant age the planet was dominated by cold-
blooded creatures. The undisputed rulers of the world were
the reptilian lizardmen. The mysterious Old Ones themselves
came not from this planet but from the great darkness. They
travelled between the stars in their silver ships by means of
immense inter-dimensional portals fashioned with arcane skills
blending both sorcery and science. In that forgotten era the Old
Ones were unchallenged masters of the universe of time and
space. Our world was but one small insignificant colony amidst
a glittering galaxy of stars.

According to the most ancient records preserved in Lustria,
themselves a cryptic and much distorted copy of even older
accounts now lost, the Old Ones discovered a dying world of
ice deserts inhabited only by primitive reptiles. They employed
their strange sorcery to arco-engineer the native creatures into
various types of workers and slaves. First of all they set the
mystical master-race of Slann to fulfil their ambitions and rule
over the rest. The Slann used the incomparable power of their
minds to reposition the planet in its orbit so that temperatures
became more tolerable and jungles grew up to cover the
equatorial regions. Most importantly they constructed a
permanent trans-dimensional gateway through the axis of the
planet. Portals over the poles allowed the Old Ones to transport
huge fleets from world to world. By this means new creatures
of many kinds were introduced including the ancestors of the
warm-blooded races such as Elves, Dwarfs and Men.

The Slann caused their lizardmen servants to raise great
pyramid cities where from mighty Slann Mages observed the
stars and contemplated the inner secrets of the multiverse.
Their great minds spanned the stars and their thoughts quested
throughout the time-stream exploring its endless weave of
possibilities and consequences. The secrets of the Old Ones lay
within their grasp and their minions flourished on the newly
made world. Mighty cities arose peopled by the lizard races.
The first Elves walked the land of Ulthuan and the Slann
nurtured them - cultivating the young race in preparation for
the troubled time that they foresaw in the stars. What they
saw was the coming of Chaos - the destruction of the Old One‘s
intergalactic civilisation and the collapse of the mighty warp
gates. Being creatures of great wisdom the Slann set about
creating new races strong enough to stand against the powers
of Chaos gathering in the outer darkness.

The coming of Chaos to the world was the ultimate test of the
Slann. Their civilisation was almost destroyed - many of the
wise ones were slain - the warp gates fell and volatile magic
flooded the world and altered it forever. But as the Slann had
planned all along - their minions proved stronger than Chaos.
The world was saved thanks to the lizard races, the first Elves,
the ancestors of the Dwarfs, and the other nascent peoples
nurtured by the Slann. But the world was changed. The efforts
of the Slann had all but finished them. Their time of greatness
was over and the remaining Slann Mages fell into a centuries
long sleep from which they awoke enfeebled and diminished
- if they awoke at all. Their great cities crumbled and declined.
Only their cold-blooded servants continued as ever, guarding
the pyramid cities and star-temples of the Slann, awaiting the
instructions of their masters with reptilian patience. So it has
been for thousands of years and now even fewer Slann remain
than ever and the great ones of old have all passed on. The
lizardmen races continue to live amongst the ruins and preserve
to this day the intent of the Old Ones if not their understanding.

== Special rules

=== Army rules

Born in Jungle:: No command penalty is applied to any units
in the Lizardmen army on account of dense terrain. The
Lizardmen‘s ruin infested jungle homeland is mostly dense
terrain and they are used to communicating through thick
jungle and narrow tunnels by a mix of instinct and bizarre sub-sonic
noises inaudible to other races.

=== Special rules

{empty}1. Skinks:: Skinks have a shooting range of 15cm and 360° vision -
stands in this unit can draw line of sight from all edges for
the purpose of evading and shooting, including shooting at
charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs Line of Sight
from it‘s front edge to charge an enemy.

2. Reptilian:: Reptilian troops can only be issued an order by a
character within 20cm. If reptilian units form part of a brigade
an order can be issued so long as all reptilian units are within
20cm of the character issuing the order. This rule represents the
creatures being cold-blooded brutes and slow to react.

3. Salamander:: Salamander stands are not deployed as
independent units. Instead, any Skink infantry unit may add
one stand of Salamanders. This brings the size of the unit to 4
stands - 3 regular stands plus the Salamander.
+
Salamanders always have the same Armour value as the rest of
their unit. They fight as part of their unit and can be removed
as a unit casualty if the player wishes.
+
Salamander casualties never count for Command penalties.
Salamander stands never cause the parent unit to be in Irregular
Formation no matter how they are placed.
+
If a Salamander stand is attached to a Skink unit the entire unit,
including the Salamander, is considered to employ ‘Salamander
Venom‘ shooting attacks. Enemy Armour saving throws suffer
a - 1 penalty when hit by Salamander Venom (eg 5+ save
requires a roll of 6).
+
Salamander stands have 2 shooting attacks, a range of 15cm,
and 360° vision in the same way as Skinks. If their unit is
charged then Salamanders can shoot in the same way as any
other shooting stand.

4. Terradon:: Terradons can fly. Terradon riders have a shooting
range of 15cm and 360° vision - stands in this unit can draw line
of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting,
including shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still
needs Line of Sight from it‘s front edge to charge an enemy.

5. Stegadon. As the Stegadon is so gargantuan, it uses a 40 x
60mm base, with the short edge being the front.
+
The Stegadon causes terror in its foes.
+
The Stegadon can only be brigaded with Skink units. It cannot
be brigaded with Skink units that have attached Salamanders.
It cannot be brigaded with any other units including with other
Stegadons.
+
The Stegadon‘s crew has a shooting range of 15cm and 360°
vision - the unit can draw line of sight from all edges of its stand
for the purpose of evading and shooting, including shooting at
charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs Line of Sight
from it‘s front edge to charge an enemy.
+
Because the Stegadon has so many hits we must consider the
possibility of hurting the beast and reducing its effectiveness.
Therefore, if a Stegadon has accumulated 6-9 hits by the end
of the Shooting or Combat phase and is no longer engaged in
combat it is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Stegadon is
badly hurt all accumulated hits are discounted and its Hits and
Attack values are halved for the remainder of the battle to 5/2
Attacks and 5 Hits.

6. Slann Mage:: The Slann Mage rides a palanquin carried by
his bodyguard of fierce Saurus warriors - his combat bonus is
due to his bodyguard. The Slann Mage is the army‘s general but
uniquely amongst commanders he cannot give orders, but has
foreseen the flow of the battle and given his Skink retainers
instructions. To represent this any Skink character within
20cm of the Slann can announce his use of the General’s Divine
Guidance - deducting -1 from his dice score (eg 8 counts as 7,
10 as 9 and so on). When Divine Guidance is used the Skink
cannot ‘Blunder’ - any roll of double 6 simply counts as a fail.
If a Divine Guidance roll is failed then the Slann’s Divine
Guidance cannot be used by any other characters that have
not ordered yet in that turn, their confusion over the mixup is
represented by adding +1 to their first order rolls.
+
In addition the Slann is a great sorcerer. He can cast spells as
a Wizard and can be given a magic item restricted to either
a general or wizard should you so wish. Slann Mages are
especially powerful wizards and to represent this can re-roll
a failed spell on any dice result except a 1. If a spell is failed
because a 1 is rolled then no re-roll is permitted. The Slann
Mage can also cast his spell using a Skink Shaman as the focus
if desired - work out range and line of sight as if the spell was
cast by the Shaman. This does not affect the Shaman‘s own
ability to cast spells that turn.

7. Stegadon Mount:: The Slann Mage may ride on top of a
Stegadon, adding +3 attacks to its rider. If he rides a Stegadon
then any unit he joins will cause terror and the usual Combat
modifier will apply. No other character can ride a Stegadon.

8. Carnosaur:: A Saurus Hero can ride a Carnosaur. If a
character rides a Carnosaur then any unit he joins will cause
terror. No other character can ride a Carnosaur.

=== Lizardmen spells

==== Gaze of Sotek

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Burning jade coloured rays leap from the wizard‘s lidded eyes
enshrouding and choking his enemies in writhing coils of
magic._

This spell can be cast on an enemy unit. The Wizard must
be able to see his target to use this spell. The spell cannot be
directed at a unit engaged in combat.

The Gaze of Sotek is treated like three ordinary shooting
attacks except that armour has no effect (all targets count as
having no armour). A unit can be driven back by the Gaze of
Sotek as with ordinary shooting.

==== Mazdamundi‘s Revenge

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 60cm#

_The wizard‘s foes bowels melt with dread or possibly something
much worse, hindering their movement as if hobbled._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the Wizard can see it or not.

The spell takes effect until the end of the opposing player‘s next
turn.

Whilst the spell lasts the unit cannot charge and if engaged
in combat will not pursue or advance. Even units that are
otherwise obliged to charge, pursue, or advance will not do so
if affected by Mazdamundi‘s Revenge.

==== Wings of the Jungle

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_An eerie aura surrounds the Wizard and his companions lifting
them into the air and transporting them effortlessly from one
place to another._

The spell can be cast on any unengaged friendly unit that the
Wizard has joined. The spell affects only a single unit, never a
brigade and there is no supporting charge possible.

The unit can be moved just as if it had received an order in the
Command phase. The Wizard is moved together with the unit
and remains joined with it. Other character stands that have
joined the unit will not move with it: they remain where they
are.

==== Shield of the Old Ones

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The enemy‘s blows are magically turned aside by the strange
power of the Old Ones._

This spell can be cast upon a friendly unit that is engaged in
combat and which is within range. The Wizard does not have
to be able to see the target to cast the spell.

The effect lasts for the duration of the following combat phase.

The unit‘s Armour value counts as 1 better up to maximum
value of 4+. I.e 0 counts as 6+, 6+ as 5+ and 5+ as 4+. If the unit‘s
Armour value is already 4+, or another bonus brings it to 4+,
this spell has no effect.
