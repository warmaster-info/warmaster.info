The land of Araby lies along the north west coast of the
Southlands between the Atalan mountains and the Great
Ocean. To the east is the Great Desert that separates Araby
from the Lands of the Dead. Although the climate is dry and
hot the western winds carry moisture laden clouds that give up
their water as they are suddenly forced upwards by tall Atalan
peaks.

The Arabians are great sailors and have for many centuries
fished the adjoining seas and traded south along the coast,
northwards to the Old World, and westwards as far as Ulthuan.
The High Elves do not permit Arabian vessels to travel further
west than Ulthuan itself, their high-prowed dhows are a
common sight in the outer harbours of Lothern. For their part
the High Elves maintain a mercantile presence in Copher and
Lashiek as they have since time immemorial. The Elves and
men of Araby had dealings even during the long centuries
when the Elves abandoned the Old World.

The mostly densely populated part of Araby lies to the north
of the River of the Serpent; the largest waterway in the land
and one of the few rivers that flows all year long. This land
is home to four great cities: Lashiek, Copher, Martek, and
Alhaka or (as it is sometimes rendered) Al-haikk which means
City of Thieves in the Arabian tongue. Each of these cities and
the surrounding lands forms an independent principality ruled
over by a Sultan or Caliph. South of the River of Serpents the
land is not so fertile and the terrain is much dryer. East of the
Atalan mountains the great desert stretches for hundreds of
miles towards the Land of the Dead.

Araby lies far from the world‘s poles and therefore from the
ultimate source of the magical winds that blow from the north.
As a result magic that is common in the Old World is far more
diffuse in Araby so it is much more difficult for sorcerers to work
their spellcraft. Arabian magic has therefore developed quite
differently than that of other men. Arabian sorcerers use their
powers to control elemental spirits of the desert, djinn, efreets,
genies and such-like spirits. These spirits are worshipped by
the superstitious people of Araby. It is commonly believed that
the spirits must be appeased with prayers and small tokens of
respect such as gifts of food and drink.

The rulers of Araby maintain their own armies based upon
the great cities and tributary tribes that live in the surrounding
lands. The leaders of these tribes are called Emirs or, amongst
the desert tribes of the south and east, Sheiks. The rules of cities
and their surrounding lands are called Sultans and the Sultan of
Alhaka is the acknowledged overlord of all the other cities of
Araby. In consequence he is also known as the Great Sultan –
the ruler of all Araby.

The Sultans are proud of their troops and especially of their
cavalry. It is popularly supposed that the horses of Araby are
descended from Elven horses brought over from the west many
centuries ago. They are graceful and swift creatures and very
highly valued. The very best of the Arabian foot-solders are
also well equipped, with steel armour, keen tulwars, gleaming
helmets, and fine silk clothing. These household troops or
guards accompany the Sultans when they travel beyond the
grounds of their magnificent palaces. The loyalty of these troops
is famous. They are amply rewarded with riches, luxuries, and
prestige as a result. As well as these regular and garrison troops
there are the irregular fighters from the desert tribes, including
camel mounted warriors from the lands to the south and east.

== Special rules

////
5: Remove extra initial .
////

{empty}1. Guards:: The Sultan‘s Guards are so unquestioningly loyal
that they will obey the first order given to them each turn on
the Command roll of 10 or less so long as the order comes from
the General himself. No penalties are applied to this order.
Further orders are given using the General‘s normal command
value and penalties. This applies only to Guards and not to
brigades that include Guards and other units.

2. Desert Riders:: Desert Riders have a shooting range of 15cm
and 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line of sight from
all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting, including
shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs
Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

3. Camel Riders:: Camel Riders ignore distance modifiers when
commands are issued to them. This applies only to Camel
Riders and not to brigades that include Camel Riders and
other units. Remember that characters are still bound by their
maximum command ranges and cannot issue orders to units
beyond range. This represents their fierce self-reliance and
their mounts‘ instinctive sense of direction allowing them to
operate effectively far from their own battle lines. Because
Camels are such intractable creatures all orders are issued with
a Command penalty of −1, this penalty applies to any unit of
Camel Riders or to any brigade that contains one or more units
of Camel Riders.

4. Magic Carpets:: Magic carpets can fly – they have been rated
as aerial ‘cavalry‘ as this is the closest categorisation to their
type. Because they are awkward flyers, they can be pursued by
any type of enemy troops. They have a shooting range of 15cm
and 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line of sight from
all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting, including
shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs
Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

5. Elephants:: Elephants cause terror. Elephants cannot be
brigaded with cavalry but can be brigaded with other types of
troops including other Elephants. If an Elephant unit would
otherwise become confused – for whatever reason – then it will
stampede instead. It is not confused and none of the normal
rules for confusion apply. Stampeding elephants automatically
cease to stampede at the end of their Command phase (note that
this is in the same way as confused units cease to be confused).
+
--
. Stampeding Elephants cannot be given orders or use
  initiative. Instead roll a dice at the start of the Command phase
  before moving anything else on initiative, and move the unit as
  follows.
+
[cols="^1,6",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
h|1–2
|Move towards the nearest enemy unit as far as possible – if
the stampeding elephants contact the enemy they automatically
count as charging even if they couldn’t see at the start of the
move. If the elephant contacts a friendly unit it counts as moving
into friends (see below).

h|3–4
|Move directly away from the nearest enemy unit as far as
possible – work out the stampede direction in the same way as you
would for an evade move. If the elephant contacts another enemy
unit it counts as charging (see above). If the elephant contacts a
friendly unit it counts as moving into friends (see below).

h|5
|Move towards the nearest friendly unit as far as possible – if the
stampeding elephants contact the friendly unit they automatically
count as charging even if they couldn’t see at the start of the move.

h|6
|Move directly away from the nearest friendly unit as far as
possible – work out the stampede direction in the same way as
you would for an evade move. If the elephant contacts an enemy
or friendly unit it counts as charging (see above).
|===

. A Stampeding Elephant unit that charges into an enemy
  or friendly unit fights in the combat phase in the same way
  as a regular charging unit. The stampeding Elephant counts
  as ‘enemies‘ for the duration of the combat and therefore
  continue to cause ‘terror‘ in opponents regardless of which side
  they are on. The Elephants count as charging in the first round.
  If the Elephants win a combat round then they must pursue if
  possible and will continue to do so each round. Should their
  opponents be destroyed they will not advance but will halt
  without reforming.

. Stampeding Elephants might conceivably move into a unit,
  therefore initiating combat, but are unable to form a battleline
  because they have insufficient movement distance. In the case
  of stampeding elephants, the combat is still fought, and the
  elephants still count as charging. It is up to the player whether
  he moves the elephants the extra distance required to make a
  battle-line or simply fights with the elephants in an irregular
  formation.
--

6. Flying Carpet:: This is considered to be a flying chariot mount.

7. Elephant:: The Elephant mount is a standard monster mount
except that a character mounted on an Elephant cannot join a
unit of friendly cavalry. A unit joined by a character riding an
Elephant causes Terror.

8. Djinn:: The Djinn accompanies its master and can transform
both of them into a whirlwind enabling the stand to fly as for
a normal flying mount. If the sorcerer has a Djinn he can also
cast the Curse of the Djinn spell with a +1 casting bonus (see
spells). Note that unusually the Djinn has +2 shooting attacks –
these are added to a stand from a unit that the character has
joined and can only be used when the character joins a unit. If
the Wizard is accompanied by a Djinn then any unit he joins
causes Terror.

=== Araby spells

==== Sand Storm

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The sorcerer commands the desert spirits to engulf his foes in a
swirling cloud of choking sand and dust._

The spell is cast upon the Sorcerer himself and affects all enemy
units within 30cm of the stand. The spell lasts until the end of
the opposing player‘s following turn.

The spell affects the opposing army‘s ability to issue commands.
All enemy units within 30cm of the Arabian Sorcerer suffer a
−1 Command penalty. This penalty is applied when each order
is issued. For example, a unit might therefore be within 30cm
of the Sorcerer for one order but not for a second, for example.

==== Mirage

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 60cm#

_The sorcerer creates the illusion of a huge host of fearsome
warriors, bearing down inexorably upon his startled foes._

To use this spell the player will need an additional unit chosen
from the Araby list – this can be infantry, cavalry or monsters
it does not matter which. This unit becomes the ‘illusion‘ and
is immediately placed within 60cm of the sorcerer and more
than 20cm from any enemy units. The illusionary unit cannot
move or fight – for it isn’t really there! However, the illusionary
unit is treated as if it were real by the enemy up until such time
as an enemy unit charges into contact with it, touches it as an
incidental contact during combat, advances upon it, or brings
it into combat in any other fashion. This means, for example,
Command penalties are suffered for proximity, and enemy
shooters are obliged to target the illusion if it is the closest
target – it cannot be harmed of course! The illusionary unit is
also dispelled immediately if the Araby player moves any of his
units or characters through it.

Whilst the Mirage unit is on the battlefield the Wizard cannot
cast any other spells – if the player wishes the Wizard to cast a
new spell the Mirage comes to an end and the Wizard can then
attempt a new spell as normal.

==== Sunstrike

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Bright beams of burning energy leap from the sorcerer‘s eyes
and scythe through all before him._

Draw an imaginary line 30cm long from the Wizard‘s stand in
any direction you wish. Each unit under the line takes three
shooting attacks worked out in the usual way all relevant
modifiers are applied. Note that this spell can easily affect
several units and will affect all units that fall beneath its path
(including you own). Unengaged units can be driven back by
Sunstrike as with ordinary shooting whether friend or foe.
Engaged units cannot be driven back but carry over any hits
that are scored into the first round of combat. Hits caused by
the Sunstrike count as having been struck in the combat itself.

==== Curse of the Djinn

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Rage 30cm#

_The Sorcerer channels the immense power of the Djinn through
his own body and lays a terrible curse upon his foes._

The Sorcerer may cast this spell on an enemy unit within range.
The target unit must re-roll all successful armour saves for the
duration of the following close combat phase.

If the Sorcerer has a Djinn then he adds +1 to his dice roll when
casting this spell, and therefore casts successfully on a 5+.
