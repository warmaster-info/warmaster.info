The Dwarfs live in fortified subterranean strongholds in the
mountainous regions of the Old World. Beneath these near
impregnable fortresses they have dug thousands of miles of
tunnels, shafts, mines and galleries. The Worlds Edge Mountains
are riddled with Dwarf delvings and constitute a hidden
underground realm as large in extent as any human kingdom.
The adjoining Grey Mountains and Dragonback ranges are also
home to Dwarfs and there are scattered settlements in most of
the mountainous regions of the Old World.

Dwarfs are attracted to these bleak places by hidden mineral
wealth and especially gold. Dwarfs are utterly besotted with
gold. They are also quite enthusiastic about gemstones and
other rare and precious metals - but most of all they love gold!
Dwarfs sing songs about gold, dig through solid rock to find
gold, and spend endless happy hours counting the gold they
possess. There are hundreds of different Dwarfish words for
gold and new ones are being coined all the time. A Dwarf who
finds himself in the presence of large amounts of the yellow
shiny stuff can easily go ‘gold crazy‘. Such an individual may
become insanely violent, even going so far as to attack his
friends and family who he believes to be “after me gold”. Given
this strong materialistic streak it is not surprising that Dwarfs
are such keen traders and merchants. They are always willing
to do business with other races - though only on cash terms -
gold always acceptable.

Dwarfs are shorter and far stouter than men or elves. They are
also much stronger and more resilient. They consider humans
and elves to be gangling weaklings liable to be blown over
in a decent breeze. Dwarfs are expert craftsmen, especially
when it comes to metal work, smithying, gemcutting and
jewellery making. Despite their cumbersome appearance they
are astonishingly skilful at making fine, intricate mechanisms
such as locks, concealed drawers, and hidden doorways. They
are adept stonemasons and take great pride in their ability to
build to last. Indeed, the phrase ‘Dwarf-built‘ is a byword for
indestructible, whilst the Dwarfish word for ‘shoddy‘ translates
quite literally as ‘manmade‘. Even the Elves consider Dwarf
metalcraft the finest in the world. Elves are less appreciative of
Dwarf taste, which they consider to be extra-ordinarily gaudy
and vulgar.

Before the coming of men the Elves established colonies in
the Old World so that they could trade with the Dwarfs. For
many years the two races benefited from this arrangement and
both peoples flourished. However, differences in temperament
doomed the relationship to inevitable failure. The Dwarfs saw
the Elves as arrogant and effeminate. The Elves thought the
Dwarfs brutish and vulgar. If Elves had been more tactful and
Dwarfs less prickly things might have turned out differently.
But it was not to be. Once war began both sides were too proud
to concede defeat.

// was reduced
After hundreds of years of continuous warfare both races were
exhausted. The Elves returned to Ulthuan and abandoned the
Old World. The Dwarfs considered themselves the victors but
their numbers were so depleted that their empire could barely
defend itself. It was at this point that hordes of greenskins
and ratmen attacked the Dwarf realm from above and below.
Many strongholds were destroyed and others damaged. The
once sprawling underground empire was reduced to embattled
enclaves in the mountains.

Today the Dwarf realm is much reduced in size and population.
Men have established themselves on the lands once fought
over by Dwarfs and Elves. The Dwarfs have learned to trade
with men and the two races have forged a mostly peaceful
relationship. It was a combined force of Dwarfs and men that
finally drove the greenskins form from the lands now known
as the Empire. It was Dwarf craftsmanship that raised the first
human cities. Relations with the Elves remain embittered.
Dwarfs never forget injustices against their own kind and
can bear a grudge practically forever. They reserve their most
heartfelt hatred for the greenskins and ratmen who have taken
over the ruins of many strongholds that are rightful property
of the Dwarfs.

== Special rules

{empty}1. Handgunners:: A handgun shot can pierce armour far more
easily than an arrow or a crossbow bolt. Therefore, count
enemy Armour values as one worse than normal when shot by
a handgun. One unit of Handgunners per full 1000 points can
replace a unit of Warriors while still counting for the Warrior
min/max value. Note that this unit still counts for max value of
Handgunners.

2. Rangers:: One unit of Rangers per full 1000 points does not
have to be deployed before the game if the player does not wish
to do so. Instead the unit can be infiltrated onto the battlefield
once the game has begun. To infiltrate a unit, the Dwarf player
nominates the point where he wants the Rangers to appear and
issues an ‘infiltration‘ order from any character. The character
does not have to be within his normal command range to
issue an infiltration order - the character‘s command range is
considered to extend over the entire tabletop when issuing an
infiltration order. Treat the order as issued to the nominated
point, and apply any modifiers for distance and proximity of
enemy, but ignore penalties for dense terrain. The nominated
point must lie either on the table within dense terrain or on
any base edge other than the enemy player‘s own table edge. If
successful, place one stand on the nominated spot and arrange
the rest of the unit into formation around it. The infiltrated
unit cannot be placed so that it touches an enemy unit. Once
deployed, orders can be given to the unit by the same character
that gave the infiltration order if he is within his normal
command range, the infiltrating unit is considered to have used
its first order to deploy. If the infiltration order is failed the unit
is not deployed and cannot infiltrate that turn, it can attempt to
infiltrate in a subsequent turn at the same or a different place.
+
Although they are infantry, Rangers can pursue any type of
retreating enemy.

3. Troll Slayers:: A Troll Slayer unit will always use its initiative
to charge an enemy if possible and cannot be given orders
instead. They will never use their initiative to evade. Troll
Slayers cannot be driven back by shooting and never roll for
drive backs. Troll Slayers must pursue or advance if victorious
in combat where they are permitted to do so. Troll Slayers are
unaffected by enemy that cause terror in combat - they don‘t
suffer the -1 Attack modifier. Troll Slayers positively enjoy
fighting monsters - the bigger the better in fact! Slayers add +1
Attack when fighting against a Monster stand.
+
Troll Slayer units earn victory points differently to other units
as follows:
+
. If a Troll Slayer unit has any stands remaining at the end of
  the battle then the full points value of the unit is awarded to the
  opposing side as victory points. It doesn‘t matter if the unit has
  3, 2 or 1 stand remaining - if there are any stands left at all the
  enemy gets the full victory points.

. If a Troll Slayer unit is destroyed no victory points are scored
  by either side.
  +
Slayer units that have been destroyed still count towards the
Dwarf army‘s losses for purposes of calculating withdrawal.

4. Cannons:: Full rules for xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#cannons[Cannons] are in the main Rulebook.

5. Flame Cannon:: The Flame Cannon is an infernal device that
shoots a gout of flame. It has range of 30cm and its attacks are
slightly unusual. Rather than having a fixed number of attacks it
has 2D6 Attacks instead - roll 2 dice and add the scores together.
But if the Flame Cannon rolls a double then it does not shoot as
expected! Depending on the double rolled something has gone
horribly wrong.

|Double Rolled |What‘s that gurgling noise?!

h|1.
|The Flame Cannon explodes and is destroyed. No attacks are
caused.

// 2D6+4 is the clearer way round
h|2.
|The Flame Cannon emits an enormous belch of fire inflicting
a total of 2D6+4 attacks on the target before it explodes and
destroys itself.

h|3.
|The Flame Cannon makes a worrying wheezing noise
before spewing out an unusually smoky flame. Six attacks
are inflicted this turn but the number of attacks caused by all
further shooting is reduced from 2D6 to 1D6.

h|4.
|The Flame Cannon splutters and its boiler goes out. The crew
scramble around to re-light it. The Flame Cannon does not
shoot this turn but it is otherwise unaffected.

// - replaced by but
h|5.
|The Flame Cannon chuffs out a great gout of soot, covering the
target in black smoke and hot coals. Ten attacks are inflicted
this turn but otherwise the Flame cannon is unaffected.

// 12+D6 changed to D6+12
h|6.
|The Flame Cannon lurches in its mountings and heaves forth
an especially huge flame inflicting D6+12 attacks on the target.
The Flame Cannon is otherwise unaffected

+
A Flame Cannon can shoot at charging enemy in the usual way.

6. Gyrocopter:: The Gyrocopter is a flying machine, so all the
usual flying rules apply. The model always forms a single
unit on its own, must be given orders individually, cannot be
brigaded with other units and cannot be joined by a character
in combat.
+
The Gyrocopter’s fast-firing gun is light in weight and fires a
small calibre shot. It counts Armour values as one worse than
normal. The Gyrocopter has 360° vision - the unit can draw line
of sight from all edges of its stand for the purpose of evading
and shooting, including shooting at charging enemies. Note that
this unit still needs Line of Sight from it‘s front edge to charge
an enemy.

7. Hero:: One Hero in the army may be upgraded to carry
an Oathstone for +15 pts. Once per game, the Hero may use
the Oathstone to inspire one unit that he has joined (except
Trollslayers). Both the Hero, and the unit he has joined, gain
+1 attack per stand, and are immune to Terror, until the end of
the combat phase.

8. Runesmith:: Although they are not wizards and cannot
therefore cast spells, Dwarf Runesmiths can combat the magic
of their enemies. If an enemy Wizard who is within 50cm of
the Runesmith casts a spell the Runesmith can attempt to ‘anti-
magic‘ it. Note that it does not matter what the spell is or where
it is cast, the Runesmith can ‘anti-magic‘ it so long as the caster
is with 50cm. To determine if this works roll a D6 - on the score
of 4, 5 or 6 the Runesmith has succeeded and the spell doesn‘t
work, it is dispelled by the Runesmith‘s defiant efforts. If he
fails then the Runesmith‘s efforts come to nothing and the spell
works as normal. A Runesmith can attempt to anti-magic any
number of spells in a turn, but only one attempt can be made to
anti-magic any individual spell - even if the army includes more
than one Runesmith and several are in range of the enemy
Wizard.

9. Anvil:: The army can only include a single anvil and it is
incorporated onto the stand of a Runesmith. If a Runesmith
stand includes the Anvil, once per battle he can add +1 to his
dice roll when he attempts to dispel enemy magic spells using
the Dwarf anti-magic ability (see Runesmith). In addition the
Runesmith can strike the Anvil during the Shooting phase of
his own turn. The anvil‘s plangent rune-song fills the Dwarfs
with even greater resolve! Roll a D6. On the score of a 4, 5 or 6
all Dwarf units within 20cm of the Runesmith are unaffected
by Terror until the start of the Dwarf player‘s next turn. On a
roll of less than 4 there is no effect.
