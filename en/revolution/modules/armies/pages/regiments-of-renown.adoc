// list, little, possibilities
Regiments of Renown is an army list expansion designed to add a little extra flavour and expand the possibilities of
standard army lists. It presents mercenary units that can be added (hired) to your existing armies. Their rules are described
on the following pages. Both players have to agree on using Regiments of Renown before the battle.

Mercenaries are a common sight on the battlefields of the
Warhammer world. Not all of them are human, although most
are. Amongst the Dogs of War, freebooters from the frozen
wastes of Norsca rub shoulders with Corsairs from Araby and
mysterious warrior monks from the east.

Sellswords are assured of ready and profitable employment.
The demand for soldiery in the Warhammer world has led to
the establishment of numerous mercenary bands – soldiers who
sold their services to whichever general happened to require
them. Although some generals are willing to hire mercenary
troops on a more or less permanent basis, most mercenaries
are hired only when needed. Besides, the fees charged by the
very best fighters are far too high for ordinary generals to pay
on a long-term basis. The most successful mercenary captains
become rich and influential in their own right, and their services
are soon in demand throughout the Old World and beyond.

There are many mercenaries around the Old World. They
mostly recruit from outlaws, pirates and renegades as well as
simple adventurers looking for a fight, wealth and fame. They
gather in wandering bands, companies and even entire armies
around a charismatic and usually infamous leader and look
for an opportunity to fight... especialy to fight for a proper
payment. They call themselves – The Dogs of War.

Around them some are more recognizable than others, mostly
by the name of their leader. In the land of Tilea – traditional
home of mercenaries – that specific and the greatest formations
are named Regiments of Renown. They are the most skilled,
acomplished and noble mercenaries affordable for the
wealthiest leaders such as kings, princes and mighty warlords.
Sometimes they may be hired even by a Dogs of War leader,
of course if he can pay enough. In the restless Old World they
usualy have full hands of work to do.

Mercenaries commonly form into itinerant bands under the
leadership of a charismatic or especially brutal leader. The most
famous of these bands are, more often than not, known by the
name of their leader, such as Verthhold Brekt’s Halberdiers,
Hagar Whitefang’s Were-Marauders, Bradan Swiftleaf’s Glade
Riders, Khalag’s Sure Shots, and the renowned Golgfag’s Ogres.

=== Army rules

// Everywhere: RoR → Regiments of Renown

// a maximum of, each full, 1000 points of, Remove Additionally
For hire:: Mercenary units are very popular in the Old World.
Each army list may add (hire) a maximum of 1 Regiments of
Renown unit for each full 1000 points of army value following the Allies
Table. Hired units count towards the maximum
allowance per 1000 points of the unit type indicated in the
Hiring Regimens of Renown section.

// the extra point value is included in the
// remove therefore
// melee → combat
// or heroes
Led by the Hero:: To represent the presence of a strong leader,
Regiments of Renown units including artillery and hero type cost 10 points more
than their equivalents in the other armies (the extra point value is
included in Regiments of Renown unit profile) and receive a +1 bonus
to the combat Attack value of one stand. Note that this gives +1
Attack in total, not +1 to each stand! This extra attack is not
included in the Army Selector profile.
+
No magic item may be given to hired Regiments of Renown units or heroes

// humanised
// a lot → greatly
// stay independent → are unaffected by
// friendly spells
// unique listed unit
Independent and Exclusive:: Mercenaries recruit from many
races and lands of the Old World. Living in the Empire
greatly ‘humanised’ them, but they still stay individual. Therefore,
they are unaffected by any army or racial special rules –
neither bonuses nor drawbacks.
+
Hired units can be ordered and brigaded without penalties, just
like the other units in your army. In case of a blunder make
separate Blunder roll for Regiments of Renown units if they are brigaded with
other troops. That means one roll for your armylist troops and
one roll for Regiments of Renown troops.
+
They cannot be targeted by friendly spellcaster’s spells and do
not receive any benefit from friendly spells and effects including
area spells and effects.
+
Additionally your army may contain only one of each unique
listed unit. If your opponent hired the same regiment, just
roll a dice and decide who got the ‘authentic’ one and who
‘impersonated’ one. Roll just for fun, without impact in the
further game.

{empty}1. Pikemen:: The pike is the traditional weapon of the
mercenaries of Tilea. Twice as long as a spear and even longer
than a cavalryman’s lance this is a truly fearsome although
rather unwieldy weapon. Due to this Pikemen never benefit
from defended or fortified status when in dense terrain (even
partially) or on fortress walls etc. They still count as defended
on higher ground or behind low obstacles as usual.
Pikemen count as defended against cavalry or chariots charging
to their front, except when the Pikemen are in dense terrain.
This bonus only applies in the first combat round
of an engagement.
+
Pikemen stands may only give or
receive support by other infantry or Pikemen stands that are
facing the same direction and touching their flank with the whole
of their own flank. Any support behind or in front of Pikemen
stand is not allowed. In all other respects they count as infantry
(movement/pursuit etc.).
+
Pikemen are based as cavalry – i.e. the models are orientated towards the
narrow edge of the base.
+

2. Dense Terrain:: Lumpin Croop’s Fighting Cocks are well used
to sneaking about in woods and bushes. No command penalty
is applied to this unit on account of dense terrain.

3. Throwing weapons:: The unit has a shooting range of only
15cm and 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line of
sight from all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting,
including shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still
needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

4. Undead:: The Cursed Company is undead, and as such the
following rules apply to them:
+
They never act on initiative. The unit only moves in the Command
phase if given orders.
+
They are unaffected by the −1 Command penalty for enemy
within 20cm.
+
They are unaffected by the −1 Combat penalty for
fighting terrifying troops.
+
They are unaffected by the Confusion rule – they cannot become
confused for any reason.

5. Repeating crossbows:: Mengil Manhide’s Manflayers are
equipped with repeating crossbows. They may shoot once at
ranges up to 30cm and twice at ranges up to 15cm. A unit of
three stands would therefore shoot 6 Attacks at a target within
15cm and 3 Attacks at a target at greater ranges. They may
shoot at enemies that charge them – in which case they shoot 1
Attack per stand regardless of range.

6. Pistols:: Long Drong’s Slayer Pirates carry pistols... loads
of pistols! They have a shooting range of only 15cm and 360°
vision – stands in this unit can draw line of sight from all edges
for the purpose of evading and shooting, including shooting at
charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs Line of Sight
from its front edge to charge an enemy.

7. Ogres:: Ogres flock to mercenaries for the chance of a
good fight and as much as they can eat. These creatures are
notoriously fond of fresh human meat, although they will eat
practically anything that was once alive (or still is). To represent
this, if an Ogre unit can use its initiative to charge an enemy
unit of humans at the start of the Command phase then it must
do so (not Dwarfs, Elves etc.).

8. Light Cavalry:: Light cavalry formations have a great use
among the mercenaries. They are experts at outmaneuvering
an enemy and harrying his flanks. Light cavalry have a shooting
range of only 15cm and 360° vision – stands in this unit can
draw line of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading and
shooting, including shooting at charging enemies. Note that this
unit still needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an
enemy.

9. Birdmen:: Only half-mad nutters like Tileans would try to fly!
The Birdmen wear insane contraptions of light wood covered
in canvas that are shaped like wings and allow them to glide
on the air currents. These ‘wings’ allow the Birdmen to fly and
still use their crossbows as normal. Because they are awkward
flyers, they can be pursued by any type of enemy troops.
Birdmen are based facing the long edge of the base in the same
way as other infantry.

10. Galloper Guns:: These are lighter artillery than Dwarf or
Empire cannons; due to this they are shorter ranged, but can
make up for their lighter shot by producing a higher volume
of fire.
+
Galloper Guns move 20cm. All the normal rules for artillery
applies as well as cannon’s rules for shooting (bounce through,
no saves and reduction of cover values). Because they are light
guns they have a range of only 40cm. They still may shoot at the
charging enemy by firing ‘grapeshot’ as normal.

11. Dragons:: Asarnil rides a Dragon. The Dragon can fly,
increasing its rider’s move to 100cm. An extra +3 Attacks are
added (included in Asarnil’s profile).
+
The Dragon can breath
fire if the character has joined a unit that isn’t engaged in
combat.
The fire breath has a range of 20cm and
can be directed against one target as for normal shooting with
3 Attacks that are worked out in the usual way.
+
Additionaly
Asarnil causes terror in his enemies.

=== Hiring Regiments of Renown

// In the whole section, p → points

// Additionally, dwarfs, "a bad idea"
Each Regiments of Renown unit counts towards the maximum
allowance per 1000 points of the unit type indicated in this
section. Additionally there are some restrictions in hiring
specified units, i.e. Dwarfs would never fight together with
Greenskins or Elves, and hiring _The Cursed Company_ together
with _The Witch Hunters_ is a bad idea.

Examples:

// chosen
* _The player hiring the Alcatani fellowship in a Dwarf army
may field up to one Ranger unit instead of up to two in a 1000 point
value army. Rangers are highest point value limited infantry
type unit in the Dwarf army._

* _The player hiring the Marksmen of Miragliano in a Chaos
army does not restrict any of his units._

* _The player hiring Braganza’s Besiegers in a Tomb Kings army
may field up to two monster types (chosen by the player)
instead of the three available in the army list for every 1000 points._

* _The player hiring Voland’s Venators in a High Elf army may
field up to two Chariot units instead of three in a 1000 point value
army or five chariots instead of six in a 2000 point value army.
Chariots are the highest point value limited units of cavalry or
chariot type in the High Elf army._

* _The player hiring Asarnil the Dragonlord in a 1000 point Araby
army can’t field a Djinn monster mount as the limit is one per
1000 points. In 2000 point army player may field one Djinn instead of two._
