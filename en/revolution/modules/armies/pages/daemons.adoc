The world is awash with unseen magic that comes from the
dark dimensions between time and space.  It was introduced
into the world when the great intra-spatial gateways of
the Old Ones collapsed, creating a rift in space and spewing
magically volatile warp-matter over the whole planet. Magic
is a malleable energy that can be harnessed and wielded, but
the very act of doing so reshapes and changes everyone and
everything it comes into contact with. Whether used for good
or ill, magic is ultimately corrupting and dangerous.

The ancient gateways continue to leak raw magic from the dark
dimension to this day. The dark dimension is home to things
of an altogether different order to mortal creatures. These are
not living creatures of flesh but a network of ethereal forces
whose consciousnesses continually flow and interchange.
Individuality and linear thought are meaningless concepts in
the dark dimension. In that timeless, spaceless, nothingness
there is only endless being: a single moment extending through
all eternity.

Just as magic pollutes and disfigures the material world so the
dark dimension is reshaped by the world of mortals. Thought,
ambition, emotion and other gross forms of individual
consciousness leak from the material universe. This focused
consciousness overwhelms and transforms the naturally
guileless intelligence of the dark dimension. It becomes aware.
It coalesces into a kind of distinct consciousness. Things stir
in the dark dimension. Gods, daemons and spirits are made
manifest in the stuff of the warp. Reshaped in turn by these
newly created consciousnesses other lesser beings are created,
and so it goes on.

Thus are the gods of the Old World, and the bitterest agents of
man‘s own destruction, self-created from the terror of mankind
itself. There may be a thousand gods or a million aspects of a
single deity – it matters little. The daemon armies of Chaos
constantly reshape and reform in the face of man‘s ever shifting
fears. Most of all men dread the elemental horrors of life, and
these are represented by the four great gods of the Marauder
tribes of the north. They are worshipped under many names
and in many guises but in the lands of the south they are
recognised (by those who dare pursue such studies) as the great
powers of Khorne the Blood God, Tzeentch the Changer of
the Ways, Nurgle the Plague Lord, and Slaanesh the Lord of
Pleasure. These are the Great Gods of Chaos of which all other
gods are but parts or conjunctions. In the lands of the Empire
many a theologist has been burned for saying as much.

== Special rules

=== Army rules

Ignore Terror:: All units ignore the −1 Attack penalty in combat
for fighting terrifying troops – you cannot frighten them at all.

Daemonic Instability:: At the start of the player’s own Command
phase, before making any initiatives moves, all friendly Daemon
units that have taken at least 1 casualty (i.e. lost at least 1 stand
out of 3) must make a ‘Daemonic Instability’ test. Roll a D6. If
the unit has lost 2 stands (i.e. has only 1 stand remaining from 3)
and is further away than 20cm from a friendly Daemon Wizard
deduct 1 from the roll.
+
[cols="^1,6",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
h|0–1
|One stand is destroyed – the daemons fade away and
are absorbed back into the Realm of Chaos from
which they came. Remove one stand from play. If
a character is with the unit and the last stand is
removed the character is destroyed too.

h|2–3
|The unit becomes confused – if not already confused
the stand becomes confused as it is torn between this
world and the next.

h|4–5
|No effect – unless the unit is confused in which case
it ceases to be confused as it is favoured with the
invigorating power of Chaos.

h|6
|The unit regains one stand. The regained stand is
placed directly behind, in front or beside another
stand from the same unit, and facing the same
direction. If it is impossible to position the stand in
in this manner then the stand cannot be added.

=== Special rules

{empty}1. Daemon Swarms:: These cannot be driven back by shooting
and do not roll for drive backs. A Daemon Swarm cannot be
given a magic item.

2. Daemon Flyers:: These can fly. Daemon flyers are an exception
to the normal conventions for basing monsters in that they face
the long edge of the stand in the same way as infantry rather
than the short edge as most other monsters.

3. Greater Daemons:: Greater Daemons can fly regardless of
whether the actual model has wings – aerial propulsion is
deemed feasible by sheer effort of will.
+
Greater Daemons cause terror in their enemies. A Greater
Daemon that has accumulated 4–5 hits at the end of the Shooting
or Combat phase and is no longer engaged in combat is deemed
to have been badly hurt. Once a Greater Daemon is badly hurt
accumulated hits are discounted and its Hits and Attacks values
are halved for the rest of the battle (to 3 Hits and 4 Attacks).

4. Daemon Overlord:: The Daemon Overlord is the army’s
General and has the option of having the powers of a Wizard
for additional 25 points. If given magical powers the Daemon
Overlord can be given a magic item restricted to either a General
or a Wizard. Note that the Daemon Overlord is still a General
and his command range extends over the whole battlefield as
for other Generals.

5. Daemonic Wings:: Some of the creatures of the deep vaults
of hell may have wings, some of them fly on hovering discs and
some even have the ability of disappearing and reappearing
wherever they want on the battlefield. Daemon characters may
be given the ability of flying.

6. Favour of the Gods:: Demon Overlord, Lords or Sorcerers can
be given the Favour of the Gods. The character gains then +1
extra Attack and causes terror in its enemies as described in the
Warmaster rulebook.

=== Daemonic spells

==== Summon Daemons

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 60cm#

_With a sulphurous blast of elemental power fresh Daemons
emerge from the warp to reinforce their beleaguered kindred._

This spell can be cast on any friendly Daemon unit of three
stands that has lost one or two stands as casualties. It does not
matter whether the Wizard can see the unit or not.

The unit regains one stand. The regained stand is placed directly
behind, in front or beside another stand from the same unit,
and facing the same direction. If the unit is already in combat
the additional stand can be placed so that it touches the enemy
and will count as charging if the unit charged. If it is impossible
to position the stand in this manner, the spell cannot be cast
and will not work.

==== Daemonic Rage

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A keening cry of pure power rises upon daemonic lips as
magical energy surges through their eldritch bodies._

This spell affects every friendly unit within range.

The spell lasts during the following Combat phase.

Every unit gains a bonus +1 attack. This attack can be allocated
to any stand in the unit and can be allocated to a different stand
in each combat round.

==== Sorcerous Blast

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_With a single gesture a bolt of black lightning leaps from
fingertip to the foe, searing the enemy with a blast of dark
power._

This spell can be cast on an enemy unit. The Wizard must
be able to see his target to use this spell. The spell cannot be
directed at a unit engaged in combat.

The Sorcerous Blast is treated like three ordinary shooting
attacks except that armour has no effect (all targets count as
having no armour). A unit can be driven back by a Sorcerous
Blast as with ordinary shooting.

==== Frenzy of Chaos

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Rumbling thunderous power surges through the daemonic
ranks driving all into a frenzied thirst for blood._

This spell can be cast upon a friendly unit which is engaged in
combat and that is within range. The Sorcerer does not have to
be able to see the target to cast the spell.

The effect lasts until the end of the following Combat phase.
The unit can re-roll any failed attacks in combat: take any dice
that fail to score hits and roll them again. Note that you cannot
re-roll a dice that has already been re-rolled either because of a
spell, magic item or any other reason.
