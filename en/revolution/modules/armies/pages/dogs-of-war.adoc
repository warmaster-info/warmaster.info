Unlike other Warmaster armies, the Dogs of War do not
come from a particular place, nor do they comprise
a particular race, although men do feature very strongly
amongst their number. They are bands of warriors who live
by fighting – fighting for pay, fighting for adventure and, most
importantly of all, fighting for the chance to win fabulous
wealth. Some are merely bandits, pirates and cut-throats of the
most untrustworthy kind, but others are gallant Princes and
buccaneers who lead bold warriors to adventure and conquest
in far away lands.

As already explained, not all mercenaries are human, although
many are. Amongst the Dogs of War, freebooters from the
frozen wastes of Norsca rub shoulders with Corsairs from Araby
and mysterious warrior monks from the east. Mercenaries
commonly form into itinerant bands under the leadership of
a charismatic or especially brutal leader. The most famous of
these bands are, more often than not, known by the name of
their leader, such as Hagar Whitefang’s Were-Marauders,
Khalag’s Sure Shots, and the renowned Golgfag’s Ogres. An
entire army of Dogs of War is made up of many of these bands
under the overall leadership of a roguish mercenary general.

Mercenary armies of Dogs of War fight all over the world.
They are drawn to places where fortunes can be won by
ruthless adventurers. The treasure-houses of the Lizardmen
in Lustria are a major prize and have attracted many a would-
be conqueror, such as the crazed Piaza Pizzaro and the near-
legendary Sven Hasselfriesian. Further east the mysterious
Dragon Isles and the shadowy lands of Cathay have tempted
soldiers of fortune such as Count Egmund Baernhof and the
infamous Thorson Grint. South to the Southlands and the
legendary treasures of Karak Zorn, eastwards to Cathay, and
west to the treasure-houses of Lustria, the world is truly awash
with rag-tag armies of sell-swords who nurture wishful dreams
of empire!

Although Dogs of War ply their bloody trade to every point
of the compass, the most notorious breeding-ground of
mercenaries is the land of Tilea in the Old World. From all the
kingdoms of the Old World and many lands beyond, sell-swords
come to Tilea where they can be assured of ready and profitable
employment. The reasons for this are quite obvious. Tilea is an
anarchic and largely ungovernable country, where selfserving
individuals rule precariously over proudly independent cities.
The real power lies with wealthy Merchant Princes who plot
and scheme against the tax-gathering authorities and each other
with almost equal enthusiasm. Indeed, such is the tradition in
Tilea that all armies of any size are mercenary armies – paid for
and deployed by a wealthy Prince, a devious merchant or some
ambitious tyrant.

Tilea is also a melting-pot to which all kinds of mercenaries
come with the notion of joining whatever overseas adventure
is flavour of the month. Such ventures are sometimes funded
by wealthy merchants keen to open up new trade routes east
and south, but often the whole thing is down to some crazed
adventurer with a theory that the world is round, cubed, the
shape of a very tall floppy hat, or some other such nonsense.
No matter what the motivation, bold armies of Dogs of War
depart every few weeks from the ports of Tilea and sail off into
the sunset. On the whole they are never heard of again, but
just occasionally a ship sails back stuffed to the gunnels with
treasure, bearing a few jewel-encrusted survivors back to a new
life of ease and luxury.

////
{empty}1. Pikemen:: The pike is the traditional weapon of the
mercenaries of Tilea. Twice as long as a spear and even longer
than a cavalryman’s lance this is a truly fearsome although
rather unwieldy weapon. Due to this Pikemen never benefit
from defended or fortified status when in dense terrain (even
partially) or on fortress walls etc. They still count as defended
on higher ground or behind low obstacles as usual.
Pikemen count as defended against cavalry or chariots charging
to their front, except when the Pikemen are in dense terrain.
This bonus only applies in the first combat round
of an engagement.
+
Pikemen stands may only give or
receive support by other infantry or Pikemen stands that are
facing the same direction and touching their flank with the whole
of their own flank. Any support behind or in front of Pikemen
stand is not allowed. In all other respects they count as infantry
(movement/pursuit etc.).
+
Pikemen are based as cavalry – i.e. the models are orientated towards the
narrow edge of the base.
+

2. Handgunners:: A handgun shot can pierce armour far
more easily than an arrow or a crossbow bolt. Therefore, count
enemy Armour values as one worse (−1) than normal. One
unit of Crossbowmen per full 1000 points can be replaced by
Handgunners (including the 10 points extra in price) while still
counting for the Crossbowmen min/max value. Note that this
unit still counts for min/max value of Handgunners.

3. Ogres:: Ogres flock to Dogs of War armies for the chance of
a good fight and as much as they can eat. These creatures are
notoriously fond of fresh human meat, although they will eat
practically anything that was once alive (or still is). To represent
this an Ogre unit must use its initiative to charge an enemy unit
of humans (humans: men, not dwarfs, elves etc.) if it is within
20cm at the start of the Command phase and the Ogres can
reach it.

4. Light Cavalry:: Dogs of War armies make great use of expert
light cavalry from all around the world. Empire Pistoliers,
Arabian Desert Riders, Hobgoblin Wolf Riders and Kislev
Horse Archers are particularly adept at outmanoeuvring an
enemy and harrying his flanks. Light cavalry have a shooting
range of 15cm and 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line
of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting,
including shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still
needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

5. Galloper Guns:: These are lighter artillery than Dwarf or
Empire cannons; due to this they are shorter ranged, but can
make up for their lighter shot by producing a higher volume
of fire. Galloper Guns move 20cm (10cm half-pace). All the
normal rules for artillery apply as well as the xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#cannons[cannon’s rules] for
shooting (bounce through, no saves and reduction of cover
values). Because they are light guns they
have a range of only 40cm. They still may shoot at the charging
enemy by firing ‘grapeshot’ as normal.

6. Giants::
include::partial$giant.adoc[]

7. Birdmen:: Only half-mad nutters like Tileans would try to fly!
The Birdmen wear insane contraptions of light wood covered
in canvas that are shaped like wings and allow them to glide
on the air currents. These ‘wings’ allow the Birdmen to fly and
still use their crossbows as normal. Because they are awkward
flyers, they can be pursued by any type of enemy troops.
+
Birdmen are based facing the long edge of the base in the same
way as other infantry.

8. Paymaster, Pay Wagon:: There may only ever be one Paymaster
in the army. Only the Paymaster may use the Wagon. If the Pay
Wagon is used the Paymaster may bribe the units around him
to fight harder. He may add +1 to all of his Command checks
for a single turn only.

9. Griffon:: Generals, Wizards and Heroes may ride Griffons.
The Griffon combines the appearance of a lion and an eagle.
These creatures are hatched from stolen eggs and hand reared
to serve as mounts for favoured individuals. The Griffon can
fly, increasing the rider’s movement to 100cm and it adding +2
Attacks to those of the rider. A unit which includes a Griffon
causes terror in its enemies.

=== Dogs of War spells

==== Ball of Flame

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A ball of flame shoots form the Wizard’s outstretched arm
burning all in its path._

Draw an imaginary line 30cm long from the Wizard’s stand
in any direction you wish. The line will pass through any
intervening units but not beyond terrain that would normally
stop a missile shot, e.g. over the crest of a hill, more than 2cm of
woodland, and so forth.

Each unit under the line takes three shooting attacks worked
out in the usual way. Note that this spell can easily affect
several units and will affect all units that fall beneath the line
(including your own). Unengaged units can be driven back
by a Ball of Flame as with ordinary shooting (even including
friends). Engaged units cannot be driven back by the Ball of
Flame but carry over any hits scored into the first round of
combat; any hits scored count as having been struck in the
combat itself.

==== Voice of Command

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Wizard’s voice booms out across the battlefield directing
troops above the tumult of combat with the magical Voice of
Command._

The spell can be cast on any unengaged friendly unit within
range regardless of whether the Wizard can see it or not. The
spell affects only a single unit, never a brigade and there is no
supporting charge possible.

The unit can be moved just as if it had received an order in the
Command phase. Character stands that have joined the unit
will not move with it: they remain where they are.

==== Weird Enchantment

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A weird enchantment forms around the target unit and engulfs
it in strange lights, scary nightmares and disorientating special
effects._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the Wizard can see it or not. The spell lasts until the
end of the opposing player’s following turn.

The unit moves at half pace in all situations: even when charging
for example. The unit counts all enemies as terrifying (−1 Attack
penalty) even when it is otherwise immune to terror. If the unit
would normally cause terror then it ceases to do so and counts
all enemies as terrifying just like everyone else. However,
if the target is Undead or Daemon it will not count enemies
as terrifying although all other penalties apply as described
(Undead and Daemons are hard to spook).

==== Teleport

[.cost]#2+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_With a swirl of his cloak, a crack of thunder and just a hint of
maniacal laughter the Wizard vanishes to reappear anywhere
on the battlefield._

The Wizard is moved to a new position anywhere on the table.
He can leave or join a unit if he wishes, enabling a Wizard
to move into or out of combat for example. Once the Wizard
has moved he can cast a second spell, but note this must be
a different spell and not a further Teleport! Roll to cast the
second spell as normal. A Wizard that Teleports successfully
can therefore potentially cast two spells that turn.
