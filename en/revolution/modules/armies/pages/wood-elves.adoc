Elves first settled in the forest of Loren long before the
civilised realms of man came int being in the Old World,
during the great period of war between the Elves and the
Dwarfs known as the War of the Beard. The first Elven settlers
of Loren sought to protect this beautiful forest realm from the
ravages of the Dwarfs, who would have felled the mighty trees
to fuel their furnaces and provide timber to build their war
machines. After many years of fighting, the War of the Beard
finally ended with the Dwarfs retreating to their mountain
halls and the Elven colonists abandoning the Old World to
protect their homeland of Ulthuan.

However, not all of the Elves returned home with the armies
and ships. Some could not bear to leave their newly founded
homes, whilst others were unwilling to return to the decadence
and intrigue of the noble courts of their homeland. Whatever
their reasons, a small number of the Elven settlers remained
in the Old World, and without the Phoenix King’s armies to
protect them, they soon took refuge with the guardians of
Loren, and made the forest their new home. The descendants
of these first colonists are the race of Wood Elves, and they
continue to protect their forested home to this very day.

It is safe to say that the Wood Elves are not the most active
campaigners in the Warhammer world; rather the vast majority
of their battles are fought in the defence of Loren – a cause
to which they are dedicated with single-minded determination.
Due mainly to their small numbers, the Wood Elves prefer to
deal with their enemies using deception and guile rather than
attacking head-on. Death through traps, ambushes and the
unseen arrow all await the unwary intruder into the enchanted
forest kingdom of the Wood Elves. Indeed, a large Wood Elf host
will only be assembled to fight an open, pitched battle under
the direst of circumstances, most often to repel a determined
invading army. In such times as these, the Wood Elf warriors
will fall upon their opponents with all the savagery of the Wild

Hunt, slaying all who would seek to despoil their beloved forest.
Often all that remains of the invaders are several large cairns,
beneath which lie the bodies of fallen enemies. These serve as
a grim warning to all who trespass beyond the boundary stones
marking the edge of the realm – you are not welcome here,
death awaits.

////

{empty}1. Glade Guard:: Wood Elves are just as famed for their bow as
their High Elf cousins, and as such Glade Guard units add +1 to
their dice roll when making shooting attacks. Therefore these
units score a hit against targets in the open on a 3+, against
defended targets on a 4+, and against fortified targets on a 5+.

2. Wardancers:: Wardancer stands are not deployed as independent
units. Instead, any Glade Guard or Eternal Guard unit may add
one stand of Wardancers. This brings the size of the unit to 4
stands – 3 regular stands plus the Wardancers stand.
+
Wardancers always have the same Armour value as the rest of
their unit. They fight as part of their unit and can be removed
as a unit casualty if the player wishes.
+
Wardancers casualties never count for Command penalties.
Wardancers stands never cause the parent unit to be in Irregular
Formation no matter how they are placed.

3. Waywatchers:: Famous for their bow skills even by a Wood
Elf standards, Waywatchers shoot the enemy with terrifying
accuracy. The add +1 to their dice roll when making shooting
attacks and these attacks are resolved at −1 Armour value of the
enemy.
+
Waywatchers can also ambush. Individual units can be
infiltrated onto the battlefield once the game has begun. To
infiltrate a unit, the Wood Elf player nominates the point
where he wants the Waywatchers to appear and issues an
‘infiltration‘ order from any character. The character does
not have to be within his normal command range to issue an
infiltration order – the character‘s command range is considered
to extend over the entire tabletop when issuing an infiltration
order. Treat the order as issued to the nominated point, and
apply any modifiers for distance and proximity of enemy, but
ignore penalties of dense terrain. The nominated point must lie
either on the table within dense terrain or on any base edge
other than the enemy player‘s own table edge. If successful,
place one stand on the nominated spot and arrange the rest
of the unit around it. The infiltrated unit cannot be placed so
that it touches an enemy unit. Once deployed, orders can be
given to the unit by the same character that gave the infiltration
order if he is within his normal command range, the infiltrating
unit is considered to have used its first order to deploy. If the
infiltration order is failed the unit is not deployed and cannot
infiltrate that turn, it can attempt to infiltrate in a subsequent
turn at the same of a different place.

4. Forest Spirits:: Forest Spirits are woodland creatures. They
are immune to terror and suffer −1 Command penalty when
being ordered by General or Noble.

5. Wild Riders:: Wild Riders receive +1 Attack in the first round
of every combat when fighting to the front.

6. Warhawk Riders:: Warhawk Riders can fly. They have a
shooting range of only 15cm and 360° vision – stands in this unit
can draw line of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading
and shooting, including shooting at charging enemies. Note that
this unit still needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge
an enemy.

7. Treeman:: Treeman can enter woods and suffers no command
penalty for being within the woods but cannot get defended
status there. Treeman causes terror.

8. Treeman Ancient:: Treeman Ancient has −1 Command
penalty when issuing orders to other than Forest Spirit units.
Can join only Forest Spirit units and is able to cast Tree Singing
spell. Units joined by Treeman Ancient cause terror. There
can ever be only one Treeman Ancient in any Wood Elf army.
Cannot be given any magic items.

9. Branchwraith:: Branchwraith has −1 Command penalty when
issuing orders to other than Forest Spirit units. Can join only
Forest Spirit units and is able to cast Tree Singing spell. Cannot
be given any magic items.

10. Giant Stag:: General, Nobles and Spell Weavers may ride a
Giant Stag. The Stag adds +1 Attack to those of its rider.

11. Unicorn:: This mount can be ridden by Spell Weaver only.
The Unicorn adds +1 Attack to those of its rider. Once per
battle the Unicorn’s magical power adds +1 to the dice when
casting a spell. The player must announce that the Unicorn’s
magic before rolling to see if the spell works. There can be only
one Unicorn in the army.

12. Warhawk:: General, Nobles and Spell Weavers may ride a
Warhawk. The Warhawk can fly, increasing its rider’s move
from 60cm to 100cm, and it adds +1 Attack to those of its rider.

13. Forest Dragon:: Generals, Nobles and Spell Weavers may
ride Forest Dragons. A Forest Dragon can fly, increasing its
rider’s move to 100cm, and adds +3 Attacks to those of its rider.
Any unit joined by a character riding a Forest Dragon cause
terror in their enemies and so long as the Dragon is attached to
a unit, it can use its Corrosive Breath attack. This is a shooting
attack with a range of 20cm, which can be directed against one
target as normal. The breath has 3 Attacks, which are worked
out in the usual way.
