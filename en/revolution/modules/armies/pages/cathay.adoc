Locate far to the east of the Old World, the Grand Empire of
Cathay is populous, wealth, and technologically advanced
in comparison to many of its neighbours. Indeed, it is the largest
and probably the most secure of the realms of men. Cathay’s
people live mostly within highly developed agricultural
systems along the great river valleys. The prosperous economy
sustains large cities which, like the empire’s northern border,
are protected by thick walls and strong garrisons. The misty
mountainous regions are less densely populated, and their
forests are home to many magical creatures, while on the
western border the Warpstone Desert is an inhospitable
territory for both friends and foes. Cathay maintains some
long-distance trade routes and cordial diplomatic relations
with other parts of the Old World, but merchants’ ships and
caravans must brave dangerous journeys to acquire luxury
items from the empire.

Ruled by the immortal Dragon Emperor and his shape-shifting
offspring, Cathay’s society is extremely hierarchical. Strong
administrative structures exist across all provinces, although
rivalries do develop between their governors. After many years
of rigorous education and training, members the upper classes
join the vast bureaucracy to become soldiers, administrators,
and sages. Long careers are then dedicated to fulfilling the
emperor’s wishes. Furthermore, sorcerers harness complex
astromancy and manifold lores. These usually seek to generate
harmony, but in times of strife they can also be used to disrupt
the empire’s enemies and shield its defenders. Additionally, at
moments of the empire’s greatest peril, the Terracotta Warriors
can be summoned magically from their underground resting
places to provide a silent and stoic bulwark against which even
the forces of Chaos have broken.

Regular taxation upon the thriving economy, augmented
by the imperial gold mines, provide great riches which the
governing elite have channelled into magnificent architectural
or engineering projects. Much of this wealth has also been
used to fund research that has pushed the boundaries of
human technological achievement. For example, the secret
of gunpowder has been known for many centuries and, in
addition to helping miners and providing firework displays
during festivals, the empire‘s handgun and rocket workshops
provide Cathay’s armies with a military advantage.

Perennial wars have been fought along all borders, but
Chaos incursions and Hobgoblin raiders have been the most
challenging, while the Dark Elves have also threatened
the empire’s coasts and its maritime trade. Happily for the
emperor, a strong cadre of professional generals and admirals
have honed their defensive tactics over many centuries and,
thus far, all invasions have been defeated.

Cathay’s armies have relied primarily upon the iron discipline
of their conscript troops. Fighting heroically, outnumbered
forces will seek to wear down their enemy in order to buy time
for overwhelming reinforcements to arrive from neighbouring
provinces. The empire has also been successful in recruiting
barbarian (Hu) tribes as mercenaries. This has often turned
a potential invaders’ strength – especially in cavalry – against
them. Thus even Ogres, Orcs, and Hobgoblins have found
themselves carrying Cathay weapons in exchange for decent
pay and regular meals.

== Special rules

=== Army rules

Structure and Discipline:: To reflect their empire’s high-quality
military organisation and command arrangements, Cathay
commanders may issue orders to brigades of up to 6 units instead
of the usual 4. However, those 6-unit brigades must include at
least 2 units of Bannermen. The 6-unit brigade cannot include
chariots, cavalry, or Terracotta Warriors.

=== Special rules

////
3: its, remove handguns,
////

{empty}1. Handguns:: Any or all of the army’s Crossbows units can be
replaced by Handguns while still counting for the Crossbow
min/max value. Their projectiles can pierce armour far easier
than a crossbow bolt. Therefore, units hit by Handguns get a −1
penalty for their armour rolls.

2. Terracotta Warriors:: These warriors are Undead, so cannot
act on initiative, are unaffected by terror or enemy within
20cm, and cannot be confused. They can only brigade with
themselves and give/receive support only to/from each other.
They can only be ordered by Sorcerers, who gain +1 command
when doing so.

3. Hu Cavalry:: They have a shooting range of 15cm and 360°
vision – stands in this unit can draw line of sight from all edges
for the purpose of evading and shooting, including shooting at
charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs Line of Sight
from its front edge to charge an enemy.

4. Rocket Launcher:: The Rocket Launcher is treated as a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#stone-thrower[Stone
Thrower] as described in the Rulebook, except it shoots
1D6 times per phase and any hits inflicted have an armour
save with a −1 modifier. If the roll for
the number of shots is 1, the Rocket Launcher has
misfired, and you must roll another D6 against the Rocket
Launcher Misfire Chart.

beyond the original target, regardless of range.
If the result is 1, don’t roll for the misfire
again. If the target is engaged in combat, the
hits are carried over into Combat phase. If
no target is behind the victim the rocket
leaves the battlefield without causing any
damage.

|*Big badaboom!* The rocket does 2D6 attacks
instead of the normal 1D6.

=== Cathay spells

==== Glory of Cathay

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Channelling powerful lores, the sorcerer gifts remarkable
accuracy and reloading dexterity to the empire‘s defenders.
Their opponents are thereby subjected to ferocious shooting._

This spell can be cast upon a friendly unit of unengaged missile-armed
infantry or chariots within range. The Sorcerer does not
need to be able to see the friendly unit nor their intended target.
When the spell is cast on a unit, it can shoot twice that turn
instead of once. If it has already shot that turn it can therefore
shoot again immediately. If it has yet to shoot it can shoot twice.
When a unit shoots twice due to Glory of Cathay the second
shot is always at a minus 1 penalty and will therefore hit on a
5+.

==== Lion Dogs Attack

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Complex astromancy allows the sorcerer to surround enemies
with bright and disorientating illusions in the form of terrible
beasts._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the Sorcerer can see it or not. The spell takes effect
until the end of the opposing player’s next turn. Whilst the
spell lasts the unit cannot charge and if engaged in combat will
not pursue or advance. Even units that are otherwise obliged
to charge, pursue, or advance will not do so if affected by this
spell.

==== Ferocity of Tigers

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_Opening a portal to the past, the sorcerer imbues Cathay‘s
troops with the spirit and stoicism of their ancestors. Filled
with an overwhelming resolve to protect the emperor, they
surge forward to slay his foes._

This spell can be cast on a friendly unit engaged in combat. The
spell can be cast regardless of whether the Sorcerer can see the
target or not. The spell lasts for the duration of the following
combat phase. Every stand in the unit adds +1 to its attacks
value. The unit also becomes immune to terror.

==== Tranquility of Heaven

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 15cm#

_Bestilling the sound and fury of battle, the sorcerer magically
deadens the fears of wavering soldiers, thus allowing the
commands of their officers to be faithfully obeyed._

All friendly units within 15cm of Sorcerer count as immune to
terror until the end of the enemy player’s next turn.
