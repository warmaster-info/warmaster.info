In ages past the land of Khemri was fertile, populous and
prosperous thanks to the waters of the Great River of Life
whose annual floods irrigated the fields and guaranteed a
bountiful harvest. Each city was ruled by a Priest King and
for many centuries these omnipotent monarchs lived and died
and were buried in tombs constructed by their faithful Liche
Priests. The bodies of the Priest Kings, and those of their most
faithful troops and retainers, were carefully embalmed and
interred with holy spells of immortality to prepare them for
the far off day of re-awakening.

Unfortunately for the Priest Kings of Khemri their dreams of
eternal life were to be realised only in the most horrific way.
A rebellious Liche Priest called Nagash overthrew the cities of
Khemri and made himself ruler of the entire land. Consequently
he was driven into exile and eventually murdered. However –
this was not the end of Nagash – for he was the greatest Sorcerer
of his day if not all of all time – and whilst the Black Pyramid
endured Nagash‘s spirit could always find refuge there. His evil
was gradually absorbed into the Black Pyramid and his body
reborn in the sorcerous sarcophagus that lay deep within.

Nagash‘s vengeance upon his enemies was absolute. From deep
within the Black Pyramid he worked upon a great spell of
death that he eventually cast upon the whole land of Khemri.
Consequently a pestilence fell upon the nation and all living
things sickened and died so that soon there were none to bury
the dead and the cities became nothing but empty tombs. What
was alive was now dead, and what was dead was revivified as
undead. On that terrible day the rulers of old awoke to the
horror that had befallen them. The golden immortality in which
they had believed had proven a false dream. The Tomb Kings
were mightily angered to discover that they had been treated
in this way – and there were a great many of them. Whole
dynasties rose as one, ancient rivals and bitter enemies side by
side. But most of all their anger was reserved for Nagash. They
saw the Black Pyramid and felt the dark winds of sorcery that
blew about its shining black walls and understood that they had
been betrayed.

From their tombs the Tomb Kings have re-ordered their
kingdoms. Their peoples, mostly interred without the benefit
of royal magic, are little more than automatons. Undead
armies wheel and manoeuvre with ingrained military instinct,
continually re-fighting old wars or pursuing new ones amidst
the dry deserts. The terrible spell that created them binds
them to their land but offers no succour. Those that perish
in battle rise each dawn whilst even those that are destroyed
entirely, burned to smoke or vaporised by sorcery, live on as
spiteful spirits that can be heard in the wailing of the wind and
groaning of great stones in the mountains. If the Tomb Kings
take any comfort it is only in the recreation of their ancient
empires – a shadow of former existence that evokes memories
of the lives that they once led.

== Special rules

=== Army rules

Undead:: Undead units never act on initiative. An Undead unit
only moves in the Command phase if given orders (except
Carrion who can also home back as noted below).
+
Undead units are unaffected by the −1 Command penalty for
enemy within 20cm.
+
Undead units are unaffected by the −1 Combat penalty for
fighting terrifying troops.
+
Undead units are unaffected by the Confusion rule – they
cannot become confused for any reason.

=== Special rules

////
6: Space before +1
////

{empty}1. Carrion:: Carrion can fly. Note that Carrion can always return
to a character by homing back at the start of the Command
phase.

2. Bone Giant:: Bone Giants cause terror. When a Tomb King
gives an order to a Bone Giant or a brigade that contains a Bone
Giant there is a −1 Command penalty. There is no penalty when
a Liche-Priest gives an order.

3. Sphinx:: Because the Sphinx has so many hits (6) we must
consider the possibility of hurting the Sphinx and reducing
its effectiveness in subsequent turns. Therefore, if a Sphinx
has accumulated 4–5 hits by the end of the Shooting phase
or Combat phase and is no longer engaged in combat it is
deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Sphinx is badly hurt
all accumulated hits are discounted and its maximum Hits and
Attacks are halved for the rest of the battle (to 3 Hits and 2
Attacks). The Sphinx causes terror.

4. Skull Chukka:: The Skull Chukka is a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#stone-thrower[Stone Thrower]
but with the following additional rule.
When a unit is driven back as a result of hits scored by a Skull
Chukka, then any dice rolled in respect to those hits will cause
Confusion on the roll of 4, 5 or 6 (rather than 6 as normal). Note
that if a unit has taken other hits as well it will be necessary
to roll the Skull Chukka dice separately. See the Artillery and
Machines section of the rulebook for the Stone Thrower rules.

5. Bone Thrower:: The Bone Thrower is a xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#bolt-thrower[Bolt Thrower] as
described in the Rulebook.

6. Tomb King:: The Tomb King is empowered by the spells cast
upon him when buried. He can use this power to increase the
Combat Attacks value of all the stands in one unit within 20cm
by +1 for the duration of one Combat phase. This ability can
only be used once per battle.

7. Zombie Dragon:: A Tomb King or Liche Priest can ride a
Zombie Dragon. A Dragon can fly increasing its rider‘s move
from 60 to 100cm and it adds +3 Attacks to those of its rider.
Zombie Dragons have a special shooting attack – they can belch
corrosive breath! This attack can only be used if the Dragon
riding character has joined a unit but is not engaged in combat.
A character that has not joined a unit cannot use the Breath
attack. The corrosive breath has a range of 20cm. It can be
directed against one target as normal and has 3 Attacks worked
out in the usual way. The Zombie Dragon is a terrifying creature –
a unit that has been joined by a Dragon riding character causes
terror in its enemies.

8. Liche Chariot:: A Tomb King or Liche Priest can ride a chariot.
A character riding a chariot adds +1 to his Attacks.

=== Tomb King spells

==== Raise Dead

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_At the Wizard‘s beckoning the mangled corpses that litter the
battleground rise from the dead to continue the slaughter._

This spell can be cast upon a combat engagement taking place
within 30cm of the Wizard. The spell can be cast regardless
of whether the Wizard can see any units in the combat
engagement or not. A single combat engagement can only be
affected once by this spell in any turn regardless of how many
units are involved in the combat. For purposes of deciding
whether a combat is eligible as a target, combat engagements
are as they appear when the die to cast the spell is rolled: so it
is possible for pursuit or advances to bring two units of raised
dead into the same engagement later on.

A Skeleton unit of three stands is created. Each stand in the
raised unit must be placed so that its front edge contacts an
enemy stand from the targeted engagement, or that it supports
a friendly stand from the same engagement, including raised
stands. The placement of stands may not split up the engagement
into multiple smaller engagements. If raised stands come into
contact with unengaged enemy units, those units will join the
engagement after the raised unit is placed, similar to incidental
contact during pursuit. If it is impossible to position all stands
in combat or support then the unit is not deployed and the spell
fails. Raised dead do not count as charging in the first round of
combat. Raised dead are ignored for working out break point
and victory points at the end of the game.

==== Touch of Death

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_The Wizard‘s enemies crumble to dust as he smites them with
the corrupting Touch of Death._

The Wizard can cast this spell if he has joined a unit in combat.
The spell can be cast on any single enemy unit that it is touching
the unit the Wizard has joined.

The target unit takes three attacks worked out in the usual way.
Any hits scored are carried over into the first round of combat
and count as having been struck in the first round for purposes
of working out combat results.

==== Doom and Despair

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 60cm#

_A dark cloud of doom and despair settles over the enemy,
sapping their courage and dampening their warlike spirit._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the Wizard can see it or not.

The spell takes effect until the end of the opposing player‘s next
turn.

Whilst the spell lasts the unit cannot charge and if engaged
in combat will not pursue or advance. Even units that are
otherwise obliged to charge, pursue, or advance will not do so
if affected by Doom and Despair. Note that even other Undead
are not immune – they are overcome by the ennui of the tomb!

==== Death Bolt

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A fearsome bolt of sorcerous lightning flies from the Wizard‘s
outstretched finger tips and strikes an enemy unit._

This spell can be cast on an enemy unit. The Wizard must
be able to see his target to use this spell. The spell cannot be
directed at a unit engaged in combat.

The Death Bolt is treated like three ordinary shooting attacks
except that armour has no effect (all targets count as having
no armour). A unit can be driven back by a Death Bolt as with
ordinary shooting.
