The armies are listed in their order of precedence using the dates they became official within the three
previous Warmaster army list sources. Thus Empire through to Dwarfs began in that sequence within the
original rulebook (2000), although the Undead were later re-designated as Tomb Kings. Skaven down to
Vampire Counts were formalised on the Specialist Games website (2006), although all except Araby had
appeared in Warmags (2001 to 2003). Dogs of War to Norse were codified collectively in the Trial Armies
supplement (2009), but with Albion, Goblins, Witch Hunters, and Wood Elves also appearing in earlier
Warmags. Finally, it should be noted that a number of the armies and variants within the Trial Armies
supplement were not transferred by the committee to this book.
