The Elven Kingdoms are the most ancient and cultured of
all the world’s realms aside from those of the cold-blooded
Lizardmen races. Long before the crude townships of men took
shape the Elves were building glittering cities in the island-
continent of Ulthuan. Soon more cities arose in their colonies
throughout the world. After millennia of habitation many of
these cities still exist. They are graced by fantastical towers,
sweeping arches, and a thousand other wonders undreamed of
by mankind. Within soaring spires the High Elves pursue their
age-long studies of art, sorcery and the world both natural and
otherwise.

The Elven mind is not only keen but is matched by a near
perfect physique and extraordinary longevity. Elves resemble
men but are taller and more elegantly proportioned with long
athletic limbs. They have lean, intelligent and handsome faces
with delicately pointed ears and entrancing almond shaped
eyes. It has been said that their swift precise movements make
the most graceful human seem oafish in comparison. These
qualities make them dangerous warriors as well as unparalleled
craftsmen and sorcerers.

Elves are not warlike by nature as are, for example, Orcs and
even Dwarfs and men to some extent. However they are proud
-some say arrogant – and ultimately confident in their purpose.
Thousands of years ago the Elves and Dwarfs fought a long and
bitter war over possession of the Old World – a war fuelled by
pride and suspicion on both sides.

This war weakened the two races to such an extent that both
were nearly destroyed as a result. Much of the Dwarf realm
was subsequently overrun by greenskins, the Elves were driven
from their cities in the Old World, and the Elven homelands
were plunged into the devastating civil war known as The
Sundering. Elves and Dwarfs have never forgotten that war and
it remains a source of recrimination and antagonism between
them to this day.

Although their strength is less than it once was the Elven
Kingdoms constitute the greatest bastion against Chaos in the
world. Millennia ago – when the Age of Chaos began – the most
adept of the High Elf Mages constructed a gigantic vortex of
power at the centre of the island-continent of Ulthuan at the
heart of the Elven Kingdoms. The purpose of this vortex was to
draw magical energy out of the world, which was at that time
overrun with daemons and other wholly sorcerous creatures.
By means of a system of magical standing stones arranged
around the circular island like a spider’s web, the power of
Chaos was gradually drawn away and stability restored. The
Daemon armies were destroyed or banished back to the Realms
of Chaos from which they had come. This is a burden that the
High Elves carry to this day. Were Ulthuan and its vortex to
fall the world would be quickly consumed in magic and mortal
creatures would cease to exist – at least in any form recognisable
as such.

The Elven Kingdoms remain eternally alert to the threat of
Chaos. They are the undisputed masters of the seas and have
fortresses situated all over the globe at strategic positions.
There they wait and watch the lights of magic playing upon
the northern skies, and prepare for the next battle against the
forces of Chaos. However, their numbers are fewer now than
ever, and the burden of defence grows ever more heavy. For
this reason the Elves regard the human realms as vital to the
eternal battle against Chaos, for if the human realms fell it
would be only a question of time before Ulthuan itself would
be overwhelmed by the tides of Chaos.

== Special rules

{empty}1. Archers:: High Elf archers add +1 to their dice roll when
making Shooting attacks. They will therefore score a hit
against targets in the open on a 3 or more, against targets that
are defended on a 4 or more, and against fortified targets on a
5 or more.

2. Giant Eagles:: Giant Eagles can fly.

3. Dragons:: Dragons can fly. Dragon rider units and any other
units that include a Dragon riding character cause terror in
their enemies.
+
Because Dragon Riders have a great many hits (6) which are
difficult to inflict even during a lengthy combat engagement,
we must consider the possibility of hurting the Dragon and
reducing its effectiveness in subsequent turns. Therefore,
if a Dragon Rider has accumulated 4–5 hits by the end of the
Shooting phase or Combat phase and is no longer engaged in
combat it is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Dragon
has been badly hurt all accumulated hits are discounted and its
maximum hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest of the
battle (to 3 Hits and 3/2 Attacks).
+
Generals, Wizards and Heroes can ride Dragons. A Dragon can
fly increasing its rider’s move from 60 to 100cm. An extra +3
Attacks are added to those of its rider. A Dragon can breathe
fire if the character has joined a unit that isn’t engaged in
combat. A Dragon ridden by a character can’t breathe fire if it
is not part of a unit.
+
Dragons can make a fiery breath. This applies both to a unit of
Dragon Riders and to Dragons ridden by characters that have
joined a unit of troops. Fire Breath works as follows. The fire
breath has a range of 20cm. Breath can be directed against one
target as for normal shooting and has 3 Attacks that are worked
out in the usual way at 4+ to hit.

4. Elven Bolt Thrower:: Rules for the Elven Bolt Thrower are
described in the xref:rules:artillery-and-machines.adoc#elven-bolt-thrower[Artillery and Machines] section in the Rulebook.

5. Wizard:: High Elf Mages are especially powerful wizards
and to represent this can re-roll a failed spell on any dice result
except a 1. If a spell is failed because a 1 is rolled then no re-roll
is permitted.

6. Giant Eagle Mount:: Generals, Wizards and Heroes can ride
a Giant Eagle. An Eagle can fly increasing its rider’s move from
60 to 100cm. An extra +2 Attacks are added to those of its rider.

7. Chariot Mount:: Generals, Wizards and Heroes can ride
Chariots. An extra +1 Attack is added to those of its rider.

=== High Elf spells

==== Storm of Stone

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The ground erupts around the Mage, and a hail of stones, rocks
and dirt hurls itself upon his foes._

This spell affects every enemy unit within range.

Every enemy unit within range takes 3 Attacks worked out in
the normal way. Unengaged units are not driven back by the
Storm of Stone (the assault comes from the ground beneath
their feet). Engaged units carry over any hits scored into the
first round of combat; any hits scored count as having been
struck in the combat itself.

==== Light of Battle

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A radiant light shines forth upon the Mage’s companions filling
them with magical vigour._

This spell affects every friendly unit within range.

The spell lasts for the duration of the following Combat phase.
Every unit and every character that has joined a unit gains a
bonus +1 attack. These attacks can be allocated to any stand in
the unit and can be allocated to a different stand in each combat
round.

==== Heaven’s Fire

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The mage imbues the Elven archers with an unearthly swiftness
enabling them to rain death upon the enemy._

This spell can be cast upon a friendly unit of unengaged missile
armed infantry or cavalry within range. It cannot be cast on
artillery. The Mage does not need to be able to see the friendly
unit nor their intended target.

When the Heaven’s Fire spell is cast on a unit, it can shoot
twice that turn instead of once. If it has already shot that turn
it can therefore shoot again immediately. If it has yet to shoot it
can shoot twice. When a unit shoots twice due to Heaven’s Fire
the second shot is always at a −1 penalty to hit.

==== Hail of Destruction

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A hail of fiery arrows flies from the Mage’s outstretched finger
tips and strikes an enemy unit._

This spell can be cast on an enemy unit. The Mage must be able
to see his target to use this spell. The spell cannot be directed at
a unit engaged in combat.

The Hail of Destruction is treated like three ordinary shooting
attacks (4+ to hit) except that armour has no effect (all targets
count as having no armour). A unit can be driven back by a Hail
of Destruction as with ordinary shooting.
