The land of Kislev lies in the north-eastern portion of the Old
World between towering mountains to the east, the barren
wastes of the Troll Country to the west and the borders of the
Empire to the south. Dense pine forests give way to scattered
birch forests and desolate tundra to the north. It is an old saying
that in Kislev the winters are long, the snow lies deep, and
enemies are never far away.

Kislev shares its southern border with the Empire but in
every other direction it is surrounded by deadly foes. The
eastern mountains are full of goblins and other greenskins
whilst beyond the lands are home to savage marauder tribes.
To the north-west is the land of Norsca – barbarians in thrall
to the Dark Gods. When the armies of Chaos gather Kislev
lies directly in their path between the forces of darkness and
the lands to the south. With typically grim humour Kislevites
describe their land as lying between the hammer and the anvil
(meaning Chaos and the Empire).

Kislev is reckoned a backward and barbarous country by the
people of the southlands. Some even go as far as to say that
the Kislevites are little better than the savage marauder tribes
themselves. There is some truth in this – because the people
of Kislev are an admixture of native Old Worlders like the
people of the Empire and a marauding Kurgan tribe called the
Gospodars. As with the tribes of Chaos there are those amongst
the Kislevites who possess the gift of prophecy and other
sorcerous abilities. The ruling family of the Tzars is descended
directly from the Sorceress Khan-Queens of the Gospodars.
Female members of the family often possess great powers. This
mixture of southern and northern blood makes the Kislevites
seem exotic and dangerous to the people of the Empire.

Many of the Tzar‘s subjects are fierce nomadic horsemen and
hunters rather than settled farmers and town-dwelling traders.
These nomads are the most savage of the Kislevites retaining
both the ancient traditions and pure blood of the Gospodars of
old. The townships of Kislev are built mainly of huge timbers.
Good building stone is rare whilst tall pine trees are plentiful.
Only the largest cities have stone walls and imposing civic
buildings constructed from masonry. Gilded domes distinguish
the temples of the strange Kislevite gods from those of the
Empire.

For many years the Tzars of Kislev have enjoyed the friendship
of the Emperor and the goodwill of the Dwarfs. The present
ruler is the Tzarina Katarina – a great sorceress known
throughout the Old World as the Ice Queen of Kislev. In her the
old powers of the Khan-Queens have resurfaced and she is both
abhorred and feared by her people, especially by the nomadic
tribes who believe her to be favoured by the ancient gods of the
Gospodars.

== Special rules

{empty}1. Winged Lancers:: Winged Lancers receive +1 Attack in the
first round of every combat when fighting to the front and are
Immune to Terror.

2. Horse Archers, Cossacks:: Kislevite Horsemen have a shooting
range of 15 cm and 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line
of sight from all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting,
including shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still
needs Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

3. Bowmen:: One unit of Bowmen per full 1000 points can
replace a unit of Axemen while still counting for Axemen min/max
value.

4. Red Guard:: In addition to traditional Kislevite long axes Red
Guard is armed with handguns. Count enemy armour values as
one worse than normal when shot by a handgun. So an armour
value of 3+ counts as 4+, 4+ as 5+, and 5+ as 6+, whilst an armour
value of 6+ can’t save against a handgun.

5. Bears:: Bears are defined as infantry for rules purposes as
this gives them the appropriate mobility for such creatures, but
they add +1 Attack when they charge an enemy in the open in
the same way as monsters and chariots.
+
A Bear unit can only give support and be supported by other
Bear units and must pursue retreating enemy where possible
and must advance if they are able to do so. Also, Bears never
count as defended outside a dense terrain.
+
Note that these rules apply only to Bear units – not to characters
riding a Bear or Shaman that have transformed in Monster
Bear.

6. War Wagon:: image:kislev/wagon-laagered.webp[width=250,height=253,float="right"]
The War Wagon consists of a wagon stand and
a horse team stand. The wagon cannot charge and moves 20cm
at full pace. The unit moving up to 5 cm after a successful order
can end its move in a laager formation. A unit moving more
than 5 cm must end its move in a column formation. Terrain
restrictions are the same as Artillery. Either stand can be
removed as causality. The War Wagon can move only when the
team stand remains.
+
The War Wagon has 4+ Armour and total of 4 shooting and 4
close combat Attacks as long as the wagon stand remains. If the
wagon stand is removed the team stand has no Armour and no
Attacks. The War wagon can shoot all round and can draw a
line of sight from any exposed edge. The wagon has a range of
30cm. The target‘s armour value counts one worse than usual.
The wagon is permitted to shoot over the heads of friendly
troops on lower ground in the same way as other Artillery.
+
A laagered wagon counts as a defended
unit. A wagon column counts as in the
open. A laagered wagon has no sides or
rear. A laagered wagon cannot be driven
back or routed by shooting. But roll for
(defended) drive backs to see if it becomes
confused. For Gerroff, roll the dice as nor-
mal and if it would normally have left the
table then roll 1 D6 and it is confused on
a 6.
+
image:kislev/wagon-column.webp[width=132,height=499,float="right"]
Although it is an artillery unit, a wagon column cannot pursue
but it is not destroyed if forced to retreat. Also, a wagon laager
will neither pursue nor retreat but is not destroyed if forced to
retreat. It also continues to count as defended in subsequent
rounds. The enemy can continue to fight by ‘pursuing‘, but
there are no pursuit bonuses. A laagered wagon cannot make
way.
+
Any Kislev infantry unit with a side edge of one stand touching
wholly the short edge of a laagered wagon stand counts as
defended for shooting and combat. This advantage applies only
in the first round of combat.

7. Bear Mount:: Generals, Heroes and Shamans can ride a Bear
mount. The Bear adds +1 Attack to that of its rider.

8. Yozhin:: This creature lives in swamps near the Praag since
the great incursion of Chaos. Yozhin strongly hates any kind
of Chaos, being (possibly) chaos-twisted creature itself. Only
powerful Shamans may summon a Yozhin and make it to fight
on their side. A single Shaman in the army can be assisted by
Yozhin. There is no restriction for going into any water/boggy/swamp
terrain for him. A unit that has been joined by a Yozhin
riding Shaman causes terror in its enemies. Yozhin adds +1
Attack to Shaman’s attacks value.

9. Tzarina:: The General may be a Tzarina of the royal blood –
perhaps Tzarina Katrina herself. The Tzarina rides a horse-
drawn sled – note this is not a chariot! The Tzarina can cast
spells like a Wizard and can carry a magic item restricted to a
Wizard if desired. Once during the battle the Tzarina can add
+1 to the dice when attempting to cast a spell. The player must
announce that the Tzarina’s special spell casting bonus is being
used before rolling for the spell.

=== Kislev spells

==== Monster Bear!

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range N/A#

_The wizard transforms himself into a gigantic ferocious
supernatural bear and hurls himself into the enemy’s ranks._

The wizard can cast this spell on himself if he has joined a unit
that is engaged in combat. The spell lasts for the duration of the
following Combat phase.

The unit causes terror and the wizard gains a further +2 Attack
bonus that he adds to the unit in the regular way. Note that if
the Tzarina uses this spell she adds +4 Attacks: +2 as General
and +2 from Monster Bear.

==== Icy Blast

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_An icy blast shoots from the wizard’s outstretched arm and
strikes his foes._

This spell can be cast on an enemy unit. The Wizard must
be able to see his target to use this spell. The spell cannot be
directed at a unit engaged in combat. The Icy Blast is treated
like three ordinary shooting attacks except that armour has no
effect (all targets count as having no armour). A unit can be
driven back by an Icy Blast as with ordinary shooting.

==== Chill

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_A fierce chill envelops the unit, freezing its warriors and
hindering its ability to fight._

This spell can be cast upon an enemy unit that is engaged in
combat and which is within range. The Wizard does not have
to be able to see the target to cast the spell. The spell lasts for
the duration of the following Combat phase. Every stand in the
unit, including characters that have joined the unit, deducts −1
from its Attacks value.

==== Freeze

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range 60cm#

_An ill wind turns the enemy so brittle that wood, flesh and even
iron shatters and falls to the ground in splinters._

This spell can be cast at an enemy unit within range regardless
of whether the wizard can see it or not. The spell cannot be
directed at a unit engaged in combat.

Roll a D6. If the score exceeds the number of hits that the target
troop type has then one stand is destroyed. If not then the target
is unscathed. If a stand is destroyed it is removed as a casualty.
A unit cannot be driven back by Freeze.
