In the dark forests of the Old World dwell the favoured
Children of Chaos: foul and unholy things that hate the world
and hide from the honest light of day. They serve no mortal
master, but belong heart and soul to the Dark Gods of Chaos.
Men call these creatures Beastmen for they are part-human and
part-beast, their twisted bodies a blasphemy of nature. They
have horns upon their bestial heads, claws and cloven hooves
adorn their limbs. Beastmen are wild and brutish creatures
that care little for other beings and despise the race of Men
above all else. They are cruel and brutal creatures who brawl
and fight amongst themselves when not venting their hatred
against mankind.

Beastmen are not natural creatures; they first came into
existence when the polar gateway of the Old Ones collapsed,
showering the world with corrupting warpstone. It worked
a dreadful change on many of the ancestors of Men, causing
severe mutations, and the descendants of the foul beasts born
from that catastrophe still plague the dark places of the world.

Neither fully man nor fully animal, Beastmen willingly
embrace their heritage of Chaos — they have the intelligence
of a man, but employ it with the base cunning of a wild animal.
To the people of the Empire, it is a deadly combination, for the
Beastmen utterly despise the Humans who they can never be,
filled with self-loathing that turns to aggressive hatred.

Malformed, base and evil, the Beastmen hate all natural and
wholesome creatures. They are wild and crude creatures of
animal lusts and an unpredictable, violent temperament. They
have long, ridged horns with which to gore their foes, and the
legs of cattle and goats with which to stamp the bodies of their
victims into the mulch. Their slavering mouths are filled with
long, wolf-like fangs perfect for tearing flesh from bone, and
their robust, heavily-muscled frames are perfectly suited to
sating the murderous desires that gleam in their blood-red eyes.

{empty}1. Gor/Ungor:: Up to half the Gor units (rounded down) and
half the Ungor units (rounded down) may be designated as
Ambushers. At the start of the game, you must inform your
opponent how many units will Ambush. Ambushers may form
Brigades or act as single units.
+
Ambushers are deployed during any Command phase, not
at the start of the game. To deploy ambushers, nominate a
character, the ambushing units and a point in a piece of dense
terrain or a point on any board edge except the enemy’s.
Issue an Ambush order to the point, which can be outside
the character’s Command range. Apply distance and enemy
proximity penalties, but ignore dense terrain penalties.
+
If the Ambush order is successful, place one stand from the
unit at the point, then deploy the rest in formation around it.
Brigade units form up within a full pace move of the first stand.
If the nominated point is in dense terrain it must be chosen
that every stand of every unit within the group must be at least
partially within the terrain. No Ambusher may deploy within 1cm
of an enemy stand.
+
After deployment, Ambushers may receive further orders if in
the Command range, but the Ambush order counts as their first
order. If the Ambush order fails, Ambushers cannot deploy that
turn but can try again later in the game.
+
Once deployed, Ambushers operate like normal units.
+
Ungor have a shooting range of 15 cm.

2. Minotaurs:: Minotaurs are subject for Bloodlust – they always
use initiative to charge if possible and cannot be given orders
instead. A unit with Bloodlust never use initiative to evade and
must pursue or advance where possible. Also, it is immune to
terror, cannot be driven back by shooting and never rolls for
drive backs.

3. Centigors:: Centigors have a shooting range of only 15cm
and 360° vision – stands in this unit can draw line of sight from
all edges for the purpose of evading and shooting, including
shooting at charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs
Line of Sight from its front edge to charge an enemy.

4. Dragon Ogres:: Dragon Ogres are immune to terror.

5. Chaos Spawn:: Spawn units have −1 Command penalty unless
part of a brigade that includes more non-Spawn units than
Spawn units. Up to two Spawn units can be included in any
brigade and do not count towards the maximum size of that
brigade.
+
Spawn units cause terror in combat – enemies suffer the −1
Combat modifier for fighting terrifying creatures. Spawn units
cannot be driven back by shooting and never roll for drive
backs. Spawn units must pursue or advance if victorious in
combat where it is permitted to do so.
+
Spawn units have a shooting range of 15cm and 360° vision –
the unit can draw line of sight from all edges of its stand for
the purpose of evading and shooting, including shooting at
charging enemies. Note that this unit still needs Line of Sight
from its front edge to charge an enemy.

6. Dragon Ogre Shaggoth:: Dragon Ogre Shaggoth must always
be given a separate order. It cannot be brigaded with other
troops even with other Shaggoths.
+
Shaggoth has a great many hits, 8 in fact, which are almost
impossible to inflict during even a fairly lengthy combat
engagement. Because Shaggoths have so many hits we must
consider the possibility of hurting the Dragon Ogre Shaggoth
and reducing its effectiveness in subsequent turns. Therefore, if
a Shaggoth has accumulated 5–7 hits by the end of the Shooting
phase or Combat phase and is no longer engaged in combat it
is deemed to have been badly hurt. Once a Shaggoth is badly
hurt then all accumulated hits are discounted and its maximum
Hits value and Attacks are halved for the rest of the battle (to
4 Hits and 4 Attacks).
+
A Dragon Ogre Shaggoth causes terror
in its enemies.

7. Doombull:: A unit joined by a Doombull cause terror. Also,
Gors, Ungors and Bestigors joined by a Doombull will become
subject to Bloodlust in the same way as Minotaur units, until
the end of the following Beastmen Command phase.

8. Tuskgor Chariot:: Beastlord or Wargors can ride a Tuskgor
Chariot. A character riding a chariot adds +1 to his Attacks.

=== Beastmen spells

==== Traitor Kin

[.cost]#4+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Shaman dominates the beasts used by the enemy, turning
them on their masters._

This spell can be cast on any enemy unit of Cavalry, Chariots or
Monsters within range regardless of whether the Shaman can
see it or not. The spell takes effect until the end of the opposing
player‘s next turn. Whilst the spell lasts the unit cannot use
it‘s Initiative. Any order given to the unit, or to any brigade of
which the unit is a part, suffers a −1 Command penalty.

==== Hunting for Gore!

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Shaman’s magic power arouses in the herd an
uncontrollable desire to tear asunder any enemy and feast on
their bloody remains. Rows of wild warriors charge headlong
into their foes._

The spell can be cast on unengaged friendly unit within range
regardless of whether the Shaman can see it or not. The spell
affects only a single unit, never a brigade. The unit can be
moved just as if it had received an order in the Command phase.
Character stands that have joined the unit will not move with
it – they remain where they are.

==== Chaos Bolt

[.cost]#5+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The dark power of Chaos pulses through the Shaman. A foul
incantation flows from his mouth which calls down a mighty
lightning bolt from the heavens above that strikes the enemy._

This spell can be cast on an enemy unit. The Shaman must
be able to see his target to use this spell. The spell cannot be
directed at a unit engaged in combat. The Chaos Bolt is treated
like three ordinary shooting attacks except that armour has no
effect (all targets count as having no armour). A unit can be
driven back by a Chaos Bolt as with ordinary shooting.

==== Power of Herd

[.cost]#6+ to cast# [.points]#Range 30cm#

_The Beastman Herd rise on the Shaman’s command.
Emboldened by his fervour they charge at the enemy with
unbridled fury._

This spell can be cast on all Gor, Ungor and Centigor units
engaged in close combat and within range regardless of whether
the Shaman can see them or not. When the spell is successfully
cast, each affected unit receives additional +1 Attack per
stand (including character stands) for the duration of its first
following combat engagement. Additional Attack bonus does
not apply when these units advance into next enemies.
