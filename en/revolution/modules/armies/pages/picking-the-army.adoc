= Picking the Army

This section of the Warmaster Armies book explains how
to choose equally matched armies to take part in a battle
and updates the original section in the main rulebook.

In theory there is no reason why forces have to be equal,
but most players prefer to fight battles between armies
that are, notionally at least, the same fighting value. To
facilitate this, all units are allocated a points value that
reflects their worth in a typical battle.

As a matter of principle the points values of individual
units are considered in proportion to the army as a whole
so that troops of comparable fighting value may be a few
points more or a few points less in some armies. This
is intentional. In these cases the marginal difference in
points is done to restrict or increase the choices available
to the player.

== The Army

Army lists and rules are provided for 25 Warmaster
armies. All armies are chosen in the same fashion using
the appropriate list. The army lists are included on the
following pages and you may wish to skip forward to
your favoured army as you read through the rest of this
section.

== Army size

Both sides select troops and characters up to the same
maximum points value. Three ‘standard‘ sized battles are
considered here. Smaller and larger battles, or battles
with intermediate points values, can also be arranged as
discussed later.

[cols="<,^",frame=none,grid=none]
|===
|Small battle   |1000 points per side
|Medium battle  |2000 points per side
|Large battle   |3000 points per side
|===

A small battle is ideal for beginners or for demonstrating
the game but the tactical possibilities are limited. Small
battles are more susceptible to the fortunes of dice rolling
than are large battles. Medium sized battles are
considered the usual kind and will typically
last for a whole evening‘s play – although
experienced players have been
known to cram four or
more such battles into
a single day.

Large battles require more leisure but offer a varied game
that better reflects the subtleties of the command system.
Substantially bigger battles can be fought with even
more points per side if players wish. Beware that a very
large game can take an entire day or even several days
to complete. There is no real maximum limit beyond
the number of models and the size of the gaming area
available. 10,000 points or more is certainly feasible.
With very large armies it helps to have additional players
to help move troops and roll dice.

Note that the army size indicates the maximum points
value that can be spent. Armies can have fewer points
than this value but cannot have more. Often it is
impossible to spend the odd few points so a medium
sized ‘2000 point‘ army might have only 1995 points of
models. Such an army is still a 2000 point army as far
as we are concerned. It is the maximum permitted value
that determines the army size not the actual points spent.

The army lists are designed to work with armies of round
thousands of points (1000, 2000, 3000, etc). However, it is
also possible to choose armies of other sizes – say 1500 or
750. This is slightly less convenient but useful if players
are still building their armies and want to use units as
they are purchased. This is explained under Selecting the
Army.

== Army lists

Begin with the army list for your chosen army. The
different lists include all the units available for each side
together with their game stats, points values and special
rules where appropriate. Most of this information is
condensed into a single stat line for each unit. Any
additional information is noted as special rules after the
army list itself. Stat lines are presented as follows:

image::picking-the-army/battle-line.webp[]

[.unit,frame=none]
|===
|Troop |Type |Attacks |Hits |Armour |Command |Unit size |Points |Min/max |Special

|Halberdiers |Infantry |3 |3 |6+ |– |3 |45 |2/– |–
|===

Type:: This describes the type of troop unit or character
stand: Infantry, Cavalry, Monster, Artillery, Machine,
Chariot, General, Wizard or Hero. Mounts for characters
are sometimes optional and are included as a separate
line as Monstrous Mount or Chariot Mount.

Attack:: The basic number of dice rolled in combat by
each stand in the unit.

Hits:: The number of hits the unit can suffer before one
stand is removed.

Armour:: The score required to nullify a hit struck on the
unit if it has armour (3+, 4+, 5+ or 6+). A unit with no
armour has a value of 0.

Command:: The Command value of a character.
Unit Size. The number of stands in a unit.
Points per Unit. The points value of a unit or character
of that type.

Min/Max:: This defines the minimum and maximum
number of units of that type which an army must include
per 1000 points of army size. A dash indicates there is no
restriction.

== Selecting the army

Choose units and characters to make up the army. You
can choose up to a maximum total value appropriate to
the size of game. For example, High Elf Spearmen are 60
points per unit so 5 such units are worth 300 points.

Players are not entirely free to select forces as they want.
Some units must always be included and some other
units can only be included in limited numbers. These
restrictions are indicated by the minimum/maximum
column (min/max) in the army lists. The min/max
value consists of two numbers separated by a slash – for
example 1/2. The first number shows the minimum
number of that unit/character the army must include
for every 1000 points of army size. The second number
shows the maximum number of that unit/character the
army can include for every 1000 points of army size.

For example, in a Bretonnian army, Squires are min/max
1/4. This means that in a 1000 point army the player must
include at least 1 unit but cannot include more than 4. In
a 2000 point army the minimum is therefore 2 and the
maximum 8, in a 3000 point army minimum 3 maximum
12, and so on.

If an entry includes a dash instead of a number this
means no minimum or maximum applies. The player
can chose as few or as many of this troop types as he
wishes within the limitations of the points available. For
example, –/2 means that in a 1000 points army there is no
minimum and the maximum is 2, while 1/– means there
is a minimum of 1 and no maximum.

All armies must include a single General. An army can
never include more than one General no matter what its
size. The Min/Max column is given as 1 to show this.
You may have decided your armies will be chosen to 1500
points or some other odd number. In this case determine
min/max values by rounding your actual army size down
to the next full 1000‘s. So, a 1500 point army is selected
using the minimums and maximums for a 1000 point
army, a 2250 point army is the same as a 2000 and so on.

If your chosen army size is less than 1000 points then
use the 1000 point maximums but ignore the minimums.
Very small games can be a useful exercise for learning
the rules but be warned that the game does not work
particularly well with extremely small forces and battles
may feel bewilderingly rapid.

The value of any permitted magic items is added to that
of the unit or character that carries them. Magic items
must be allocated to specific characters and a separate
note made. This will increase the points value of the unit
or character appropriately, and the total cost must be
taken into account when working out victory points. See
Magic in the rulebook p.76 or a Magic Items Overview
on p.88 in this book.
