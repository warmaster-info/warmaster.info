= Movement

////
// WMR original
Units move when given an order as explained in the
Command section or by using their initiative as
explained later in this section. The distance a unit can
move depends upon its troop type and formation. Some
troops are naturally faster than others, cavalry are faster
than infantry for example. Also, troops arranged in a
regular formation are able to move more quickly than
units in an irregular formation.

[.bo5a]
Units move when given an order or by using initiative in the
Command phase as explained in the Command section.
Units can also move in the Shooting or Combat phases as
explained in the corresponding rules sections. This section
covers all the general movement rules for units including rules
for various types of terrain. Rules for moving characters can be
found under the xref:characters.adoc[Generals, Heroes and Wizards] section.

== Movement distances

[.bo5a]#The maximum distance a unit can move depends upon its troop
type and formation. Some troops are naturally faster than others –
cavalry are faster than infantry, for example.#
Troops arranged in a
regular formation are able to move more quickly than
units in an irregular formation.

Broadly speaking, infantry units and monsters move
up to 20cm at a time, cavalry and chariots move 30cm
and artillery, such as stone throwers and cannons, move
10cm. Flying troops can move up to 100cm but their
movement is governed by special rules, as described
later. The chart below gives the full pace move distances
for each troop type plus the half pace movement. In each
case, distances are maximums and the player can move
the unit a shorter distance if he wishes.

You’ll find a few exceptions to these moves in the army lists later in the book but for now we
don’t need to worry about these oddities.

== [.bo5a]#Formation#

////
// WMR original
Units must be arranged in formation, by which we mean
that all stands in the unit must touch at least one other
stand in the unit. Players can arrange the stands as they
want so long as they touch either along an edge or at a
point.
////

[.bo5a]
Each unit must be arranged in formation. By this we mean that
all the stands in the unit are placed in touch so they form a *line*,
*column* or *irregular* formation, as described below.

////
// WMR original
. Units charging or evading can move up to full pace
  regardless of their formation. Charging is discussed
  in detail in the Combat phase section and evading is
  described later in this section under Moving By Initiative.
////

[.bo5a]
Units *charging* or *evading* can move up to full pace regardless
of their formation. Charge and evade moves are described later
in this section.

All units wholly or partially in a fortified position at
the start of their movement can only move at half pace
regardless of their formation unless they are charging or
evading, in which case they move at full pace as noted
above. [.bo5a]#See xref:shooting.adoc#defended-fortified-targets[Shooting] and xref:combat.adoc[Combat] for
more about defended and fortified units.#
// TODO link

Units arranged in a *column* with stands placed one
behind the other (as shown in picture below), either
edge-to-edge or corner-to-corner, can move at full pace
unless in a fortified position as noted above.
// Units in a column are said to be in a *regular* formation.

.In a column stands are placed behind each other either edge to edge (as on the left) or so that they touch at a point forming a curved column (as on the unit following the road). This formation is primarily suited to movement.
image::movement/column-formation.webp[]

image::movement/helm.webp[]

Units arranged in a straight *line* with all their stands
facing in the same direction and butted edge-to-edge move
at full pace unless in a fortified position, as noted earlier.

.Infantry and cavalry arranged into a straight line. This is the most effective fighting formation.
image::movement/cavalry-line-formation.webp[]

image::movement/infantry-line-formation.webp[]

All units in other formations or circumstances move at
half pace. For example, infantry are able to move up to
10cm, cavalry up to 15cm and so on. This represents the
fact that the unit is out of regular formation and that it is
necessary to regroup in order to move. For convenience,
we refer to all these formations as *irregular*. Note that
the only situation where an irregular formation moves
at full pace is when it charges or evades.

.Units in irregular formations move at half pace to represent the fact that their ranks are disrupted.
image::movement/irregular-formation-1.webp[]

image::movement/irregular-formation-2.webp[]

In some circumstances, units move a distance
determined by rolling dice or by the results of combat
(such as drive backs, retreat moves and advances). These
distances are not affected by the unit’s formation.

include::partial$divider-axe.adoc[]

[.h-bo5a]
== The move

When moving a unit, move each stand one at a time.
Experienced players usually find it convenient and
quicker to move whole units at once but in principle,
stands always move one at a time to ensure a path can be
traced.

// Ancients/Bo5a: Paragraph break added

Select one stand from the unit and move it. Then
move the second stand into formation with it. Then move
the third to complete the formation (assuming a unit of
three stands). Note there is no need for the unit to retain
its original formation – the stands are simply re-arranged
as needed when the unit moves.

// TODO: add diagram (Ancients) and "See".

All stands must be able to trace a clear path to their
position in the unit’s final formation. Stands do not have
to move to their front – they can move backwards, to the
side, at an angle or in any orientation or direction.

.Stands in the same unit must touch but can be arranged into any formation you like.
image::movement/infantry-line-formation.webp[]

image::movement/formation-touch-2.webp[]

image::movement/formation-touch-3.webp[]

No part of a stand can move further than its permitted
maximum movement distance. Always measure from
the part of the stand that moves the greatest distance
– this will often be one of the corners.

// TODO: add diagrem (Ancients) and "See"

A stand cannot
move through the base area of a stand from *another* unit
whether friend or foe either wholly or in part. A stand
can move through other stands of the *same* unit if they
have not yet moved and are not engaged in combat. This
allows stands to move out of their own unit’s formation
without jamming each other. Even where they belong to
the same unit. A stand cannot move through other stands
who have already moved or are engaged in combat.

[.bo5a]
Stands can move through terrain appropriate to their type as
note below. Stands cannot move through terrain if it is
impenetrable to their type.  See the section on <<terrain>>.

There is an exception to the rule that prevents stands
moving through other units – this happens when a unit
bursts through another during an evade and is <<the-path-of-evaders,described
later>>.

Stands can always move through characters
as described in the xref:characters.adoc[Generals, Heroes and Wizards section].

[.h-bo5a]
=== Moving through gaps

When a stand moves, it can be oriented to pass through
any gap so long as the gap is at least as wide as the stand’s
shortest edge, usually this will be 20mm. For example,
an infantry stand might be turned to its side to move
through a gap between impassable walls and a river.

////
// WMR original
The exception to this rule is that a stand cannot pass
through a gap between two enemy stands, or between
an enemy stand and any feature or friendly stand, unless
the gap is wider than the stand’s own frontage, as shown
in <<move-through-gap>> and <<cannot-move-through-gap>>. For example, there must be
a gap of more than 40mm for an infantry stand to pass
between two enemy stands, between an enemy stand
and a friendly stand, or between an enemy stand and the
edge of a river.
////

[.bo5a]
Except as noted later, a stand cannot pass through a gap between
any of the following unless the gap is *wider* than the stand’s
*frontage*: two enemy stands, an enemy stand and a friendly
stand, or an enemy stand and impassable terrain. This means that
the gaps must be more than 40mm for infantry and more than
20mm for cavalry.  [.wmr]#See <<move-through-gap>> and <<cannot-move-through-gap>>.#

// TODO check? Ancients has some extra here.
This rule prevents units moving through gaps whilst
close to enemy units and where there is little room for
effective manoeuvring. Note that although stands are not
permitted to pass between enemy stands as described,
this does not prevent them moving between such stands
to charge them, assuming there is room to do so (See
xref::combat.adoc#moving-chargers[Moving Chargers]).

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.Infantry move through a gap – this is allowed so long as the gap is at least 20mm wide. The unit has been moved into a column – but stands could equally well be placed into a line or in irregular formation within the defile.
image::movement/move-through-gap.webp[id=move-through-gap]

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.This infantry unit cannot move through the gap between the two enemy units. A gap between enemy or between enemy and impassable terrain must be wider than a stand’s front for it to pass through.
image::movement/cannot-move-through-gap.webp[id=cannot-move-through-gap]

=== Terrain

It is well known fact that terrain features radically affect
strategy, providing strong points to defend as well as
obstructions to movement.

*Infantry* can move into or over terrain features with no
reduction to their movement distance.

*Cavalry* and monsters can’t move into or over terrain
features on the battlefield except for hills, bridges,
shallow fordable rivers, grown fields and low obstacles
(hedges, walls, fences or ditches, for example).

*Chariots and artillery* cannot move into or over terrain
features on the battlefield except for hills and bridges.

*Machines* have special rules but in general treat terrain
in the same way as chariots.

There are rules in the rulebook and army lists referring
to some terrain features as a *dense terrain*. A *dense
terrain* imposes −1 Command penalty as described in
xref::movement.adoc#terrain[Command phase – Terrain]. Typical dense terrain
features are woods, built-up areas and broken or marshy
ground (for more detail see xref::advanced-terrain-rules.adoc[Advanced Terrain Rules]).

Any other feature large enough to warrant representation
on the tabletop is considered to form a barrier to cavalry,
chariot, monster, machine and artillery movement
(unless players choose to agree otherwise before the
game).

Hills can be moved over by all troops if they are
essentially open and quite shallow but steep, rock strewn
or wooded hills are considered impenetrable to all units
except infantry.

In some exceptional cases, terrain might be considered
a barrier to all troops, including infantry as well as
cavalry, etc. Obvious examples include a huge canyon,
a lake of molten lava, the ocean or an especially large
river. These are unusual and entertaining features but
don’t really enter into the majority of games, so we won’t
concern ourselves with them any further. If you refer to
the Advanced Terrain Rules section you’ll find further
examples of rules for unusual terrain.

Rules occasionally oblige units to move into terrain they
cannot cross. If units attempt to move into terrain they
cannot cross they will halt at the edge. If they are *driven
back* into impassable terrain as a result of shooting or
magic, they may become *confused* (see the xref::shooting.adoc[Shooting
Phase] section and the xref::confusion.adoc[Confusion section]). If a
unit is forced to retreat into impassable terrain during
combat, then stands may be destroyed as a result (see
xref::combat.adoc#retreats[Combat phase – Retreats]).

=== Fortifications and buildings

High walls, tall towers and large buildings block
movement as you might reasonably expect. In these
cases, troops must move through gateways or gaps. The
exception to this is flying troops and this is covered in
detail in the section on Flying Units.

The only time when ground troops can move across
an intact curtain wall, tower or similar fortification is
when infantry are making an assault as described in the
chapter xref::siege-and-fortresses.adoc[Siege & Fortresses]. Assaulting troops
come prepared with scaling ladders, grappling hooks,
siege towers and a hefty dose of grim determination.

// == Moving by initiative
// Moved to Command chapter (xref:command.adoc#initiative-movement[]).

=== The path of evaders

When troops evade, they move directly away from the
closest enemy they can see up to their full pace move,
by at least 1 cm. When we say ‘directly away’ or, for that
matter, ‘directly towards’, the direction is established by
placing a tape measure between the closest points of the
closest two opposing stands. Where stands are equally
close, the evading player may choose between them. The
resulting line indicates the exact direction in which the
evaders move. See <<evade-direction>>.

image::movement/anvil.webp[]

Move the evading unit one stand at a time. First, move
the evading stand that is closest to the enemy. This stand
must move in a straight line in the indicated direction
directly away from the evaded enemy. The stand can be
oriented to face any direction during its move allowing
the evaders to move through gaps, turn to face their
enemy, or change the stand’s final facing. Move the
rest of the stands one stand at a time and arrange them
into the unit’s new formation. Remember to take into
account any necessary distance required to reorient
stands as they move.

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.The evaders move in a line established by placing a tape measure between the closest points of the closest stands – in this case A and B.
image::movement/evade-direction.webp[id="evade-direction"]

.Optional rule
****
*Light Cavalry:* a Cavalry unit with 6+ Armour can
evade in any direction, not just directly away from
the enemy. Note that it is still obliged to move in a
straight line when evading.
****

Evading units cannot move through terrain they could
not normally enter, nor through enemy units or combat
engagements. An evading unit must end its move at least
5cm from any enemy unit or any unit engaged in combat.
If unable to comply, units cannot evade.

An evading unit can move through a friendly unengaged
unit if the player wishes assuming the evaders have
sufficient move to pass completely through. This is called
a *burst through* and is an exception to the normal rule that
units can’t move through each other. The burst through
represents a situation where trained troops in good order
manoeuvre through each other, one unit opening up its
ranks to allow the other to pass. See <<evade-burst-through>>. This
obviously takes time, so a unit which is burst through is
automatically *confused*! See the xref::confusion.adoc[Confusion section].

== Units which move off the table

Sometimes units or characters are obliged to move
off the table. This can happen when a unit receives a
‘blundered’ order but can also happen to units that are
defeated in combat or troops driven back by missile fire
or magic.

If one or more stands in a unit leaves the table edge,
whether wholly or partially, the whole unit leaves the
table. Units that leave the table as a result of retreating
from combat are deemed destroyed. In any other
situation roll a D6 and then consult the table below to
see what happens. Deduct −1 from the roll for each of the
unit’s stands that has already been removed as a casualty
and apply the result immediately.

[cols="^1,<3",frame=none]
|===
|D6 |Result

|0 or less
|The unit/character leaves the battlefield and
does not return. The unit/character is
considered to have been destroyed.

|1–2
|The unit/character leaves the battlefield and
may or may not reappear. At the start of its
side’s next turn, before initiative moves are
made, roll again on this chart.

|3–4
|The unit/character reappears at the table edge
at the same point it left. The unit/character
cannot move further that turn.

|5–6
|The unit/character reappears at the same
point on the table edge it left from. If it is
reappearing at the beginning of a turn, it may
move as normal.
|===

When a unit reappears on the table it must retain the
same formation and face the same direction as when it
left the table.

Characters who move off the table with units they have
joined suffer the same fate as the unit. Characters who
are on their own must roll in the unlikely event that they
leave the table.

If a General leaves the table (for whatever reason) and
does not return immediately then the battle is over and
his army withdraws. He abandons his army and heads
for the hills and is considered to be a casualty. See the
End of the Battle section.
