= Movement

////
// WMR original
Units move when given an order as explained in the
Command section or by using their initiative as
explained later in this section. The distance a unit can
move depends upon its troop type and formation. Some
troops are naturally faster than others, cavalry are faster
than infantry for example. Also, troops arranged in a
regular formation are able to move more quickly than
units in an irregular formation.
////

[.bo5a]
Units move when given an order or by using initiative in the
Command phase as explained in the Command section.
Units can also move in the Shooting or Combat phases as
explained in the corresponding rules sections. This section
covers all the general movement rules for units including rules
for various types of terrain. Rules for moving characters can be
found under the xref:characters.adoc[Generals, Heroes and Wizards] section.

== Movement distances

[.bo5a]#The maximum distance a unit can move depends upon its troop
type and formation. Some troops are naturally faster than others –
cavalry are faster than infantry, for example.#
Troops arranged in a
regular formation are able to move more quickly than
units in an irregular formation.

Broadly speaking, infantry units and monsters move
up to 20cm at a time, cavalry and chariots move 30cm
and artillery, such as stone throwers and cannons, move
10cm. Flying troops can move up to 100cm but their
movement is governed by special rules, as described
later. The chart below gives the full pace move distances
for each troop type plus the half pace movement. In each
case, distances are maximums and the player can move
the unit a shorter distance if he wishes.

== [.bo5a]#Formation#

////
// WMR original
Units must be arranged in formation, by which we mean
that all stands in the unit must touch at least one other
stand in the unit. Players can arrange the stands as they
want so long as they touch either along an edge or at a
point.
////

[.bo5a]
Each unit must be arranged in formation. By this we mean that
all the stands in the unit are placed in touch so they form a *line*,
*column* or *irregular* formation, as described below.

////
// WMR original
. Units charging or evading can move up to full pace
  regardless of their formation. Charging is discussed
  in detail in the Combat phase section and evading is
  described later in this section under Moving By Initiative.
////

[.bo5a]
Units *charging* or *evading* can move up to full pace regardless
of their formation. Charge and evade moves are described later
in this section.

All units wholly or partially in a fortified position at
the start of their movement can only move at half pace
regardless of their formation unless they are charging or
evading, in which case they move at full pace as noted
above. [.bo5a]#See xref:shooting.adoc#defended-fortified-targets[Shooting] and xref:combat.adoc[Combat] for
more about defended and fortified units.#
// TODO link

Units arranged in a *column* with stands placed one
behind the other (as shown in picture below), either
edge-to-edge or corner-to-corner, can move at full pace
unless in a fortified position as noted above.
// Units in a column are said to be in a *regular* formation.

.In a column stands are placed behind each other either edge to edge (as on the left) or so that they touch at a point forming a curved column (as on the unit following the road). This formation is primarily suited to movement.
image::movement/column-formation.webp[]

Units arranged in a straight *line* with all their stands
facing in the same direction and butted edge-to-edge move
at full pace unless in a fortified position, as noted earlier.

.Infantry and cavalry arranged into a straight line. This is the most effective fighting formation.
image::movement/cavalry-line-formation.webp[]

image::movement/infantry-line-formation.webp[]

All units in other formations or circumstances move at
half pace. For example, infantry are able to move up to
10cm, cavalry up to 15cm and so on. This represents the
fact that the unit is out of regular formation and that it is
necessary to regroup in order to move. For convenience,
we refer to all these formations as *irregular*. Note that
the only situation where an irregular formation moves
at full pace is when it charges or evades.

.Units in irregular formations move at half pace to represent the fact that their ranks are disrupted.
image::movement/irregular-formation-1.webp[]

image::movement/irregular-formation-2.webp[]

In some circumstances, units move a distance
determined by rolling dice or by the results of combat
(such as drive backs, retreat moves and advances). These
distances are not affected by the unit’s formation.

include::partial$divider-axe.adoc[]

[.h-bo5a]
== The move

When moving a unit, move each stand one at a time.
Experienced players usually find it convenient and
quicker to move whole units at once but in principle,
stands always move one at a time to ensure a path can be
traced.

// Ancients/Bo5a: Paragraph break added

Select one stand from the unit and move it. Then
move the second stand into formation with it. Then move
the third to complete the formation (assuming a unit of
three stands). Note there is no need for the unit to retain
its original formation – the stands are simply re-arranged
as needed when the unit moves.

// TODO: add diagram (Ancients) and "See".

All stands must be able to trace a clear path to their
position in the unit’s final formation. Stands do not have
to move to their front – they can move backwards, to the
side, at an angle or in any orientation or direction.

.Stands in the same unit must touch but can be arranged into any formation you like.
image::movement/infantry-line-formation.webp[]

image::movement/formation-touch-2.webp[]

image::movement/formation-touch-3.webp[]

No part of a stand can move further than its permitted
maximum movement distance. Always measure from
the part of the stand that moves the greatest distance
– this will often be one of the corners.

// TODO: add diagrem (Ancients) and "See"

A stand cannot
move through the base area of a stand from *another* unit
whether friend or foe either wholly or in part. A stand
can move through other stands of the *same* unit if they
have not yet moved and are not engaged in combat. This
allows stands to move out of their own unit’s formation
without jamming each other. Even where they belong to
the same unit. A stand cannot move through other stands
who have already moved or are engaged in combat.

[.bo5a]
Stands can move through terrain appropriate to their type as
note below. Stands cannot move through terrain if it is
impenetrable to their type.  See the section on <<terrain>>.

There is an exception to the rule that prevents stands
moving through other units – this happens when a unit
bursts through another during an evade and is <<the-path-of-evaders,described
later>>.

Stands can always move through characters
as described in the xref:characters.adoc[Generals, Heroes and Wizards section].

image::movement/helm.webp[]

[.h-bo5a]
=== Moving through gaps

When a stand moves, it can be oriented to pass through
any gap so long as the gap is at least as wide as the stand’s
shortest edge, usually this will be 20mm. For example,
an infantry stand might be turned to its side to move
through a gap between impassable walls and a river.

////
// WMR original
The exception to this rule is that a stand cannot pass
through a gap between two enemy stands, or between
an enemy stand and any feature or friendly stand, unless
the gap is wider than the stand’s own frontage, as shown
in <<move-through-gap>> and <<cannot-move-through-gap>>. For example, there must be
a gap of more than 40mm for an infantry stand to pass
between two enemy stands, between an enemy stand
and a friendly stand, or between an enemy stand and the
edge of a river.
////

[.bo5a]
Except as noted later, a stand cannot pass through a gap between
any of the following unless the gap is *wider* than the stand’s
*frontage*: two enemy stands, an enemy stand and a friendly
stand, or an enemy stand and impassable terrain. This means that
the gaps must be more than 40mm for infantry and more than
20mm for cavalry.  [.wmr]#See <<move-through-gap>> and <<cannot-move-through-gap>>.#

// TODO check? Ancients has some extra here.
This rule prevents units moving through gaps whilst
close to enemy units and where there is little room for
effective manoeuvring. Note that although stands are not
permitted to pass between enemy stands as described,
this does not prevent them moving between such stands
to charge them, assuming there is room to do so (See
xref::combat.adoc#moving-chargers[Moving Chargers]).

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.Infantry move through a gap – this is allowed so long as the gap is at least 20mm wide. The unit has been moved into a column – but stands could equally well be placed into a line or in irregular formation within the defile.
image::movement/move-through-gap.webp[id=move-through-gap]

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.This infantry unit cannot move through the gap between the two enemy units. A gap between enemy or between enemy and impassable terrain must be wider than a stand’s front for it to pass through.

[.h-bo5a]
== The evade

////
// WMR original
When troops evade, they move directly away from the
closest enemy they can see up to their full pace move,
by at least 1 cm.
////

[.bo5a]
An evade is a deliberate attempt to avoid an enemy by using
initiative to move away. Evading units always move directly
away from the closest enemy they can see.

[.bo5a]
Evading units can move up to a full pace move regardless of their
formation. They can move less if they want.

When we say ‘directly away’ or, for that
matter, ‘directly towards’, the direction is established by
placing a tape measure between the closest points of the
closest two opposing stands. Where stands are equally
close, the evading player may choose between them. The
resulting line indicates the exact direction in which the
evaders move. See <<evade-direction>>.

//Move the evading unit one stand at a time. First, move
//the evading stand that is closest to the enemy.

[.bo5a]#Move the evading stand that is closest to the enemy first.#
This stand
must move in a straight line in the indicated direction
directly away from the evaded enemy. The stand can be
oriented to face any direction during its move allowing
the evaders to move through gaps, turn to face their
enemy, or change the stand’s final facing. Move the
rest of the stands one stand at a time and arrange them
into the unit’s new formation. Remember to take into
account any necessary distance required to reorient
stands as they move.

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.The evaders move in a line established by placing a tape measure between the closest points of the closest stands – in this case A and B.
image::movement/evade-direction.webp[id="evade-direction"]

.Optional rule
****
*Light Cavalry:* a Cavalry unit with 6+ Armour can
evade in any direction, not just directly away from
the enemy. Note that it is still obliged to move in a
straight line when evading.
****

// Bo5A says 1cm, not 5.
Evading units cannot move through terrain they could
not normally enter, nor through enemy units or combat
engagements. An evading unit must end its move at least
5cm from any enemy unit or any unit engaged in combat.
If unable to comply, units cannot evade.

An evading unit can move through a friendly unengaged
unit if the player wishes assuming the evaders have
sufficient move to pass completely through. This is called
a *burst through* and is an exception to the normal rule that
units can’t move through each other. The burst through
represents a situation where trained troops in good order
manoeuvre through each other, one unit opening up its
ranks to allow the other to pass. See <<evade-burst-through>>. This
obviously takes time, so a unit which is burst through is
automatically *confused*! See the xref::confusion.adoc[Confusion section].

[.h-bo5a]
== The charge
// Moved from Combat chapter (was Moving Chargers)

The rules for moving chargers may look a bit intimidating
at first but do not worry! Almost all moves happen in an
obvious way. Many of the following rules are intended
to overcome any unusual circumstances you might come
across where care may be needed.

=== Sequence of charges

The term ‘charge’ describes a unit’s movement into
contact with an enemy unit during the Command
phase whether by initiative or by means of an order.
Units which move by initiative are moved before units
which move by orders but, apart from this, there is no
obligation to move charging units in any particular order.
Charges occur throughout the Command phase as units
move against enemy units.

Where a charge is intended,
the player must say so before any stands are moved as
this alerts both players to the need for care. A unit is not
obliged to charge just because the player has stated it –
the move may prove impossible or player might simply
change his mind for any reason.

[.bo5a]
During a charge, each stand can move up to its full pace distance
regardless of the unit’s formation at the stand of the move.

image::combat-phase/orc-boss.webp[]

=== Enemy in sight

At least one stand from the charging unit must be able to
see the target enemy unit at the start of the unit’s charge
move. If none of a unit’s stands can see the intended
target then it cannot charge it.
[.bo5a]#See the section on xref:game-values#visibility-on-the-battlefield[Visibility on the battlefield]#.
Note that because units
move one after the other it is possible for one
unit’s move to clear or block the line of sight
for another; it is therefore important to take
care when deciding which units to move and
in what sequence.

[.h-bo5a]
=== Front, flank and rear

[.bo5a]
The charging unit can potentially contact against the front, side
or rear of an enemy — this is an important distinction because
stands suffer a penalty if enemy are fighting to their side or rear
as described in the xref:combat.adoc[Combat] section.

For purposes of working out where to position units
during a charge, the area around each stand is divided
into four zones as shown on the accompanying diagrams.
The division between each zone bisect the corners of the
stand at the angle of 135 degrees relative to the edge.
Zones are self evident in most situations and can be
checked using a simple guide if necessary. See <<zone-infantry>>
and <<zone-cavalry>>.

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/zone-infantry.svg[id=zone-infantry]

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/zone-cavalry.svg[id=zone-cavalry]

Once a unit’s intention to charge has been declared,
begin by considering the position of the entire charging
unit relative to the *closest visible stand* in the target
unit. If the charging unit begins its move in the stand’s
front zone then it charges to the front, if it begins to the
stand’s flank it charges in the side, and if it begins to the
rear it charges in the rear. See <<charge-move-1>>.

// Spelling front, e.g.
If the charging unit is not entirely within a single
zone then it counts as being in the zone that it mostly
occupies. So, if a unit is between the front and flank but
the greater proportion is to the front, the unit counts as
in the front. If a unit is positioned in such a way that it
is exactly divided between two zones then roll a dice
to decide – e.g. 1, 2, or 3 the front; 4, 5, or 6 the side. See
<<charge-move-2>>.

image::combat-phase/chaos-knights.webp[]

=== The charge move

In most situations it is a simple matter to position the
charging unit against the indicated front, side, or rear
edge of the enemy unit. In some cases extra care is called
for. Players who are unfamiliar with the game should
make a point of moving the stands one at a time, as
described below, until they are used to the placement
rules.

To begin, the charging player selects one stand from
the charging unit. Any stand may be chosen – it does
not have to be the closest. This stand must be able to
see the enemy and must have a clear path to the target.

The selected charging stand is moved into place against
the enemy stand that has already been identified as the
closest visible stand to the charging unit.

Move the charging stand so that its front edge contacts
the appropriate edge of the enemy stand. If the unit is
charging from the front zone, place the charger against
the enemy stand’s front edge.
[.bo5a]#If it is charging from the flank, place the charger against
the side. If from the rear, place the charger against the rear edge.#

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/charge-move-1.svg[id=charge-move-1]

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/charge-move-2.svg[id=charge-move-2]

////
// Warmaster original
When placing the first charging stand, position it exactly
centre-to-centre against the indicated edge of the target
stand. If this is impossible because of interposing stands
or scenery then place the charger as closely as possible to
the centre of the target stand. There must be at least 1cm
of clear base edge on the target stand to place the first
charging stand otherwise the move is not allowed (see
Blocked Edges).
////

[.bo5a]
If possible, place the charging stand exactly centre-to-centre
against the edge of the target stand – see <<maximise-frontage-1>>. If this is
impossible, for whatever reason, see <<unable-to-contact-centre-to-centre>>.

// Moved slightly earlier
// Spelling against
image::combat-phase/maximise-frontage-1.svg[id=maximise-frontage-1]

image::combat-phase/chaos-knight-hero.webp[]

=== Forming a battle line

Once the first charging stand has been positioned, the
remaining stands are placed one at a time to make a
line formation or ‘battle line’. Each stand must be able
to trace a line to its new position as it moves. Note that
it doesn’t matter what formation the unit is in when it
begins its charge, charging units always form a battle
line if they can do so [.bo5a]#– if they
are unable to do so then see <<unable-to-form-a-battle-line>> below.#

//Stands are placed into a coherent formation as they move.
[.bo5a]#To form the battle line,#
place the second stand beside the first, and place the third
stand beside either the first or second. You cannot leave
a gap in the battle line and then fill it later. The reason
for breaking down movement by individual stands is to
make sure each stand has an accessible route to its final
place in the battle line.

// Moved slightly earlier
image::combat-phase/maximise-frontage-2.svg[id=maximise-frontage-2]

Each stand must be placed in the battle line in such a way
that as much of its front edge as possible makes contact
with the enemy. This is called ‘*maximising frontage*’. If it
is impossible to place a stand into the battle line so that
its front edge makes contact with an enemy, then it must
be placed so that its front corner touches an enemy if it
can. This means that the maximum number of charging
stands will be drawn into the combat.

image::combat-phase/dwarf-warriors.webp[]

=== Contact with other enemy

If there are other enemy units adjacent to the target unit
then the obligation to ‘maximise frontage’ extends to
these other units too. So, where there is another enemy
stand aligned to the target unit, a charging stand must be
placed against this second enemy if this is its only way
to *maximise frontage*. However, chargers will always
maximise frontage against the unit they *originally*
charged where they can do so.

Any additional units contacted by charging stands
count as being charged and are drawn into the combat
engagement – even if they are only touching corner-to-
corner. If armed with appropriate weapons they can
shoot at the chargers as described in the Shooting section.

// TODO: bo5a/ancients diagram.

image::combat-phase/helm.webp[]

=== Supporting Charges

// Moved from Combat section.  It's maybe not ideal to have
// support mentioned here, but it's already in this general
// section under Enveloping Charge.

During the Command phase, an [.edit]#infantry# unit is allowed to make
a supporting charge if it is positioned behind another [.edit]#infantry unit#
so that at least one stand could theoretically support in
combat from the rear.  [.edit]#(See xref:combat.adoc#supporting-troops[Supporting troops] in the Combat section.)#

If the front unit charges, whether on initiative or by
means of an order, then the second unit can automatically
make a supporting charge. It can do so whether the first
unit charges on initiative or with an order, even where
the second unit was not included in a brigade order.

Note that the second unit might have more or fewer
stands than the charging unit, or it could have some
stands positioned to give rear support and some not.
Regardless of how stands are positioned, only one unit
can make a supporting charge on behalf of another. It
is not possible to place two units so that they can both
make supporting charges – in such a situation, the player
must choose which unit will make the supporting charge.

The supporting charge is a normal move, except the unit
making the supporting charge must be placed so that
it touches the first unit and at least one stand supports
it either from the rear or side. No stands can be placed
into [.edit]#contact# with enemies – neither into edge contact nor
corner-to-corner contact.

The supporting charge is a special kind of combined
move – the supporting unit’s move is rolled into that
of the charging unit and is considered part of it. The
charger can be thought of as carrying the supporting
charger with the same order. If a unit is unable to move
for whatever reason (if it is confused for example), or
if it does not have sufficient move distance to move (if
it is in irregular formation for example) then it cannot
make a supporting charge. Also note, that after *failing* to
receive its *first order* a unit cannot use its half pace move
to join combat by moving into the *supporting position*.

image::combat-phase/sword-banner.webp[]

=== Exceptions & anomalies

In some situations the proximity of scenery or other
stands makes it impossible to position all the chargers
exactly as described. In some cases this may mean the
charge is not permitted, in others that chargers can
be repositioned to accommodate the situation. These
circumstances are covered in the following rules sections.

=== Unable to contact centre-to-centre

The first charging stand is always positioned centre-to-centre
with the closest enemy stand where possible.
If this is not possible then the first charging stand is
positioned as closely to centre-to-centre as it can go, but
there must be at least 1 full centimetre of exposed stand edge to
contact against.

If there is less than 1 cm of exposed edge then the stand
is not an eligible target because it is ‘blocked’. See below
for how to deal with blocked stands.

image::combat-phase/charge-blocked.svg[id=charge-blocked]

image::combat-phase/dwarf-hero.webp[]

=== Unable to form a battle line

If a stand has insufficient room or insufficient move
distance to form a straight battle line, it must be placed
either directly behind, or beside and staggered back from
a stand that has already moved. Stands placed behind
must be positioned facing the same direction as the stand
in front of them. Stands that are staggered back can be
placed with as much or as little of their stands touching as
the player wishes, but must contact with a fellow stand
at least corner to corner. Either way the unit must retain
a coherent formation with all stands touching. If a unit
is unable to both charge *and* retain a coherent formation
then the move is not allowed. See <<f-unable-to-form-a-battle-line>>.

Any additional enemy units contacted as a result of the
placement of these stands also count as being charged
and are drawn into the combat engagement – even if
chargers are only touching at their side or rear edge.
If armed with appropriate shooting weapons they are
entitled to shoot at the charging unit as described in the
Shooting section.

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/unable-to-form-a-battle-line.svg[id=f-unable-to-form-a-battle-line]

=== Blocked edges

// Spelling available
In some situations a charging unit will be unable to
charge because, although it can see the enemy unit,
the indicated edge of the closest stand is blocked.
The indicated edge could conceivably be blocked by
impassable terrain, by other enemy stands, or by stands
from other friendly units that have already engaged the
enemy unit in combat. Remember, an edge is blocked not
only if it is completely covered, but also if there is less
than 1cm of exposed edge available to contact.

In all these situations the charger moves the charging
stand against the next closest stand in the target unit,
assuming this stand is an accessible visible stand within
the same zone. If this stand edge is also blocked then the
charger can move to the third closest stand, and so on.

image::combat-phase/closest-visible-stand.svg[id=closest-visible-stand]

If no accessible edge is presented by any stand in the
target unit then the charge is not normally allowed – for
example, if there is impassable terrain covering the unit’s
front edge and the charger is positioned in the target’s
front zone. The exception to this is a ‘pinned’ enemy unit
as described below.

=== Pinned targets

If the indicated edge of the entire enemy target unit
has already been covered by stands from other friendly
units then the unit is described as *pinned*.

////
// Difference with Bo5A/Ancients
[.bo5a]#Note that *all* appropriate
edges have to be covered by opposing stands – not by a mix of
opposing stands and terrain for example.#
////

In the case
of a pinned target, the first charging unit can move into
corner-to-corner contact with the closest enemy stand
assuming the charger can see it and has a clear path.
This is an exception to the normal rule that stands must
charge edge-to-edge. See <<f-pinned-target>>.

////
// Significant difference with Bo5A, where the
// charging stand is allowed to wrap around to the
// flank (in the illustrated example)
////

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/pinned-target.webp[id=f-pinned-target]

=== Irregular formations

If the target unit is in irregular formation then it might
not be possible for all the charging stands to engage by
forming a conventional battle line. In this case the first
charging stand is placed in the standard way as already
described. It is only the remaining chargers that are
placed differently.

Remaining charging stands are placed in a line but
staggered to the front or rear so that they follow the
shape of the stands presented by the enemy unit.

Although these charging stands might touch the enemy
only at a corner or along part of their front edge, they
are considered to be maximising frontage so long as they
have the maximum portion of enemy stand directly to
their front.

image::combat-phase/irregular-formations.svg[id=f-irregular-formations]

=== Enveloping charge

The ‘envelop’ rule applies when a unit is charged in the
side – it represents a unit’s inability to turn enough troops
quickly enough to avoid being enveloped by an enemy
charge. The reason for this rule is to avoid situations
where it is otherwise disadvantageous to charge a unit in
the side because only a single stand can touch.

include::partial$divider-sword.adoc[]

When a unit charges an enemy unit from the flank
and contacts only against the side of an enemy stand
or stands, then any charging stands that would not
otherwise touch the enemy when forming a battle line
are allowed to make a further move into contact with
the charged enemy unit as described for a pursuit. Stands
must have sufficient move distance remaining from their
charge move to make the envelopment move.

This is called an ‘enveloping charge’ and it is entirely up
to the charger whether to envelop or form a conventional
battle line. Each stand enveloping in this way must move
so that its front corner contacts the charged enemy unit,
otherwise these stands can be positioned as the player
wishes so long as they remain in formation. Enveloping
stands can contact other enemy units and therefore
bring them into the combat, but they must also contact
the charged unit either to their front edge or front corner
as described. Note that this is comparable to a normal
pursuit move in most respects – the enveloping charge
effectively combines a charge and pursuit into a single
move.

If chargers are infantry with supporting chargers then
move both the charging and supporting units and work
out any shooting first. Supporting units remain in their
battle line and do not envelope.

== Units which move off the table

Sometimes units or characters are obliged to move
off the table. This can happen when a unit receives a
‘blundered’ order but can also happen to units that are
defeated in combat or troops driven back by missile fire
or magic.

If one or more stands in a unit leaves the table edge,
whether wholly or partially the whole unit leaves the
table. Units that leave the table as a result of retreating
from combat are deemed destroyed. In any other
situation roll a D6 and then consult the table below to
see what happens. Deduct −1 from the roll for each of the
unit’s stands that has already been removed as a casualty
and apply the result immediately.

|The unit/character leaves the battlefield and
does not return. The unit/character is
considered to have been destroyed.

|1–2
|The unit/character leaves the battlefield and
may or may not reappear. At the start of its
side’s next turn, before initiative moves are
made, roll again on this chart.

|3–4
|The unit/character reappears at the table edge
at the same point it left. The unit/character
cannot move further that turn.

|5–6
|The unit/character reappears at the same
point on the table edge it left from. If it is
reappearing at the beginning of a turn, it may
move as normal.
// Difference: Ancients says no initiative moves for 5-6, orders only.
|===

When a unit reappears on the table it must retain the
same formation and face the same direction as when it
left the table.

////
// Difference: Ancients says rear edge against the table edge, facing forward.
Infantry in line or column, cavalry in a line.
////

Characters who move off the table with units they have
joined suffer the same fate as the unit. Characters who
are on their own must roll in the unlikely event that they
leave the table.

If a General leaves the table (for whatever reason) and
does not return immediately then the battle is over and
his army withdraws. He abandons his army and heads
for the hills and is considered to be a casualty. See the
xref:end-of-the-battle.adoc[End of the Battle] section.

== Terrain

[.bo5a]
By terrain we mean woods, hills, rivers and other features that
might conceivably be found on the battlefields.
Many of these features hinder troops
because they impose a Command penalty. In some cases,
features can be impenetrable to one or more troop types.
[.edit]#This can# radically affect
strategy, providing strong points to defend as well as
obstructions to movement.

[#open-ground]
[.ancients]
Open ground:: This is the term used for the
predominantly open area of the battlefield represented by
the flat table surface. Of course, in reality even supposedly
open and level ground is likely to be slightly undulating
and might include any number of individual trees, the
odd house, a few boulders, and so on. For our purposes,
the flat table surface will provide perfectly serviceable.

////
*Infantry* can move into or over terrain features with no
reduction to their movement distance.

*Cavalry* and monsters can’t move into or over terrain
features on the battlefield except for hills, bridges,
shallow fordable rivers, grown fields and low obstacles
(hedges, walls, fences or ditches, for example).

// Comment: I understand "grown fields" to mean "cultivated fields",
// i.e. "Loose terrain". This is then consistent with cavalry
// being unable to enter dense terrain.

*Chariots and artillery* cannot move into or over terrain
features on the battlefield except for hills and bridges.

// Comment: conflicts with description of Villages

*Machines* have special rules but in general treat terrain
in the same way as chariots.

There are rules in the rulebook and army lists referring
to some terrain features as a *dense terrain*. A *dense
terrain* imposes −1 Command penalty as described in
xref::movement.adoc#terrain[Command phase – Terrain]. Typical dense terrain
features are woods, built-up areas and broken or marshy
ground (for more detail see xref::advanced-terrain-rules.adoc[Advanced Terrain Rules]).

Any other feature large enough to warrant representation
on the tabletop is considered to form a barrier to cavalry,
chariot, monster, machine and artillery movement
(unless players choose to agree otherwise before the
game).

Hills can be moved over by all troops if they are
essentially open and quite shallow but steep, rock strewn
or wooded hills are considered impenetrable to all units
except infantry.

In some exceptional cases, terrain might be considered
a barrier to all troops, including infantry as well as
cavalry, etc. Obvious examples include a huge canyon,
a lake of molten lava, the ocean or an especially large
river. These are unusual and entertaining features but
don’t really enter into the majority of games, so we won’t
concern ourselves with them any further. If you refer to
the Advanced Terrain Rules section you’ll find further
examples of rules for unusual terrain.

Comment: It's thoroughly confusing having the terrain
rules split between two chapters, especially when some
of the differences are fairly minor (muddy vs cultivated fields).
////

[#dense-terrain]
[.edit]
Dense terrain:: Several terrain features listed here,
and some rules in the army lists, refer to *dense terrain*.
Only infantry can enter dense terrain, and units suffer a −1 Command
penalty if any stand lies within dense terrain when an order
is given as described in xref::command.adoc#dense-terrain[Command penalties].

// (Breaking description list)

[#low-visibility-terrain]
[.edit]
2cm visibility terrain:: When within woods and villages,
troops cannot draw a line of sight except that stands placed
within 2cm of the edge can see out, and can be seen by troops
outside.
+
By the same token, troops further inside the woods or village
can see and be seen by other troops up to 2cm away.

[.h-edit]
=== Types of terrain

// Minor spelling/grammar
Hills and slopes::
These impose no penalties on the movement of
troops. All units can move over hills and slopes so long as
they are not especially steep, rugged, or otherwise difficult
– such features must be stated before the game. The overall
footprint of hill models, including slopes, blocks line
of sight. Infantry and artillery stands positioned on a hill
are xref:combat.adoc#defended[*defended*] against any units charging or shooting from
a lower positions.

////
// Difference
[.bo5a]
Steep hills and slopes:: Slopes that are extremely steep,
rugged or otherwise hard going are considered to be *dense
terrain*. Dense terrain is impenetrable to all troops apart from
infantry. Only infantry stands can enter dense terrain, and units
suffer the -1 Command penalty if any stands lie within
dense terrain when an order is given.
////

// Comment/question/TODO: Is this undefended from shooting?
Shallow rivers or streams:: This terrain [.edit]#is impenetrable to#
chariots, artillery and machines. Infantry
can be xref:combat.adoc#defended[*defended*] along the river’s edge against enemy
charging from within or across a stream. Streams and
shallow rivers don’t block line of sight.

Broken or marshy ground:: This includes areas that are
hard going for whatever reason; for example treacherous
ruins, entangling scrub, irrigated or excessively muddy
fields or soft marshy ground. [.edit.]#Only infantry can enter this *<<dense-terrain,dense terrain>>*, which#
doesn’t block line of sight. Infantry stands are
xref:combat.adoc#defended[*defended*] in broken or marshy ground.

// Comment: Sand dunes are *very* difficult to climb or cross,
// and don't really belong here.
Loose terrain:: Cultivated fields to sand dunes, rocky
ground to fully grown corn fields. This terrain doesn’t
necessarily give a defender any advantages, but it isn’t
going to do anything to help the chargers advance.
Charging units earn *no charging bonus* when charging
a unit within loose terrain. It is also impenetrable to
chariots, artillery and machines. Loose terrain doesn’t
block line of sight.

Woods and tall scrub:: These consist of substantial
areas of growing trees or tall vegetation. Only infantry
[.edit]#may# enter and stands count as xref:combat.adoc#defended[*defended*] when within.
Woods and tall scrub are *<<dense-terrain,dense terrain>>* with [.edit]#*<<low-visibility,2cm visibility>>*#.

// Difference: Ancients/Bo5A: only infantry can enter, 2cm dense terrain, just another forest.
Villages, [.edit]#towns,# and other built-up areas::
A distinguishable
bordered area consisting of [.edit]#multiple# buildings,
paths, dividing walls,
gardens, pasture, orchards and so forth. The
entire built-up area is considered to be a broad terrain
type: no account is taken of individual buildings,
[.edit]#etc#. All units may enter, infantry and artillery
count as xref:combat.adoc#defended[*defended*] when within. All units
can be *pursued* when starting their retreat in this terrain
type. Villages and towns are *<<dense-terrain,dense terrain>>* with *<<low-visibility,2cm visibility>>*.

Individual buildings, [.edit]#boulders# or terrain features:: These are
significant structures, interconnected buildings or terrain
features such as boulders. These are impenetrable to all
units and block line of sight.

Rivers, lakes and other deep water::
Ravines and deep pits::
These are
impenetrable to all units and don’t block line of sight.

Sheer cliffs and mountains::
These are impenetrable to all units and block line of sight.

// Bo5A difference: dense terrain penalty still applies
Roads and tracks:: These permit movement to units in
column formation as for open ground regardless of the
type of terrain traversed. A [.edit]#stand# placed centrally across
or along a road is conveniently assumed to be travelling
along it despite the road’s width. Infantry placed on a
road through dense terrain still counts as xref:combat.adoc#defended[*defended*],
other troop types count as ‘in the open’ as usual.
If a unit moves its entire distance along a road then the
*next order* will be issued with a +1 to command. Roads
obviously don’t block line of sight.
+
// Spelling i.e.
Some players may prefer to move their infantry in
*marching column* along the roads in the same way
as cavalry, with the short edge to the front. This is perfectly
possible and the 20mm side can be treated as the ‘front’ for
the purpose of moving and [.edit]#determining line of# sight, however it still counts
as the side when in combat with all the [.edit]#resulting# consequences.

// Spelling bridges. Separate as they are slightly different (chariots).
Bridges:: If a river or ravine has a bridge then all
troops may cross at that point without penalty.
Bridges don’t block line of sight.

// Bo5A: obviously doesn't consider artillery/machines, so bridges are the same as fords.
Fords:: If a river has a ford, all troops except chariots,
artillery or machines may also cross at the ford without
penalty. Fords don’t block line of sight.

Low linear obstacles::
These are features such as ditches,
hedges, fences, and low walls primarily intended to form
property boundaries, divide fields or confine animals.
Low linear obstacles impose no restriction or penalties
on the movement of infantry, cavalry or monsters, but
cannot be crossed by chariots, artillery or machines.
Infantry and artillery stands placed behind a low linear
obstacle count as xref:combat.adoc#defended[*defended*]. Low linear obstacles don’t
block line of sight.

// Spelling defence
High linear obstacles:: These are tall features such as
high walls and hedged, fenced or ditched embankments
primarily intended for defence. These features are
impenetrable to all troops except for infantry. Infantry
can move over or through a high linear obstacle without
penalty. Infantry and artillery stands placed behind
a high linear obstacle count as xref:combat.adoc#fortified[*fortified*]. High linear
obstacles block line of sight.

City and fortress walls::
High walls, tall towers and large buildings block
movement as you might reasonably expect. In these
cases, troops must move through gateways or gaps.
+
The only time when ground troops can move across
an intact curtain wall, tower or similar fortification is
when infantry are making an assault as described in the
chapter xref::siege-and-fortresses.adoc[Siege & Fortresses]. Assaulting troops
come prepared with scaling ladders, grappling hooks,
siege towers and a hefty dose of grim determination.

[.h-bo5a]
=== Units forced into impenetrable terrain

The rules occasionally oblige units to move into terrain they
cannot [.bo5a]#enter. Stands are not permitted to move
so that their bases intersect with terrain that is impassable to
them – either wholly or partially. Stands will automatically#
halt at the edge [.bo5a]#of terrain they cannot enter#.

// TODO: link, and be more definite.
If they are *driven back*
into impassable terrain as a result of shooting or
magic, units may become *confused* (see the xref::shooting.adoc[Shooting
Phase] section and the xref::confusion.adoc[Confusion section]). If a
unit is forced to retreat into impassable terrain during
combat, then stands may be destroyed as a result (see
xref::combat.adoc#retreats[Combat phase – Retreats]).
