= Movement

Units move when given an order as explained in the
Command section or by using their initiative as
explained later in this section. The distance a unit can
move depends upon its troop type and formation. Some
troops are naturally faster than others, cavalry are faster
than infantry for example. Also, troops arranged in a
regular formation are able to move more quickly than
units in an irregular formation.

== Movement distances

Broadly speaking, infantry units and monsters move
up to 20cm at a time, cavalry and chariots move 30cm
and artillery, such as stone throwers and cannons, move
10cm. Flying troops can move up to 100cm but their
movement is governed by special rules, as described
later. The chart below gives the full pace move distances
for each troop type plus the half pace movement. In each
case, distances are maximums and the player can move
the unit a shorter distance if he wishes.

== Formation & Movement

Units must be arranged in formation, by which we mean
that all stands in the unit must touch at least one other
stand in the unit. Players can arrange the stands as they
want so long as they touch either along an edge or at a
point.

. Units charging or evading can move up to full pace
  regardless of their formation. Charging is discussed
  in detail in the Combat phase section and evading is
  described later in this section under Moving By Initiative.

. All units wholly or partially in a fortified position at
  the start of their movement can only move at half pace
  regardless of their formation unless they are charging or
  evading, in which case they move at full pace as noted
  above. We’ll be introducing further rules for fortified
  troops in the Combat phase section.

. Units arranged in a column with stands placed one
  behind the other (as shown in picture below), either
  edge-to-edge or corner-to-corner, can move at full pace
  unless in a fortified position as noted above. Units in a
  column are said to be in a *regular* formation.
+
.In a column stands are placed behind each other either edge to edge (as on the left) or so that they touch at a point forming a curved column (as on the unit following the road). This formation is primarily suited to movement.
image::movement/column-formation.png[]
+
image::movement/helm.png[]

. Units arranged in a straight line with all their stands
  facing in the same direction and butted edge-to-edge move
  at full pace unless in a fortified position, as noted earlier.
  Units in a line are said to be in a *regular* formation.
+
.Infantry and cavalry arranged into a straight line. This is the most effective fighting formation.
image::movement/cavalry-line-formation.png[]
+
image::movement/infantry-line-formation.png[]

. All units in other formations or circumstances move at
  half pace. For example, infantry are able to move up to
  10cm, cavalry up to 15cm and so on. This represents the
  fact that the unit is out of regular formation and that it is
  necessary to regroup in order to move. For convenience,
  we refer to all these formations as *irregular*. Note that
  the only situation where an irregular formation moves
  at full pace is when it charges or evades.
+
.Units in irregular formations move at half pace to represent the fact that their ranks are disrupted.
image::movement/irregular-formation-1.png[]
+
image::movement/irregular-formation-2.png[]

. In some circumstances, units move a distance
  determined by rolling dice or by the results of combat
  (such as drive backs, retreat moves and advances). These
  distances are not affected by the unit’s formation.

=== Moving the stands

When moving a unit, move each stand one at a time.
Experienced players usually find it convenient and
quicker to move whole units at once but in principle,
stands always move one at a time to ensure a path can be
traced. Select one stand from the unit and move it. Then
move the second stand into formation with it. Then move
the third to complete the formation (assuming a unit of
three stands). Note there is no need for the unit to retain
its original formation - the stands are simply re-arranged
as needed when the unit moves.

All stands must be able to trace a clear path to their
position in the unit‘s final formation. Stands do not have
to move to their front - they can move backwards, to the
side, at an angle or in any orientation or direction.

.Stands in the same unit must touch but can be arranged into any formation you like.
image::movement/infantry-line-formation.png[]

image::movement/formation-touch-2.png[]

image::movement/formation-touch-3.png[]

No part of a stand can move further than its permitted
maximum movement distance. Always measure from
the part of the stand that moves the greatest distance
- this will often be one of the corners. A stand cannot
move through the base area of a stand from *another* unit
whether friend or foe either wholly or in part. A stand
can move through other stands of the *same* unit if they
have not yet moved and are not engaged in combat. This
allows stands to move out of their own unit‘s formation
without jamming each other. Even where they belong to
the same unit. A stand cannot move through other stands
who have already moved or are engaged in combat.

There is an exception to the rule that prevents stands
moving through other units – this happens when a unit
bursts through another during an evade and is described
later (p.24). Stands can always move through characters
as described in the Generals & Heroes section (p.59).

=== The gap rule

When a stand moves it can be oriented to pass through
any gap so long as the gap is at least as wide as the stand’s
shortest edge, usually this will be 20mm. For example,
an infantry stand might be turned to its side to move
through a gap between impassable walls and a river.

The exception to this rule is that a stand cannot pass
through a gap between two enemy stands, or between
an enemy stand and any feature or friendly stand, unless
the gap is wider than the stand’s own frontage, as shown
in <<move-through-gap>> and <<cannot-move-through-gap>>. For example, there must be
a gap of more than 40mm for an infantry stand to pass
between two enemy stands, between an enemy stand
and a friendly stand, or between an enemy stand and the
edge of a river.

This rule prevents units moving through gaps whilst
close to enemy units and where there is little room for
effective manoeuvring. Note that although stands are not
permitted to pass between enemy stands as described,
this does not prevent them moving between such stands
to charge them, assuming there is room to do so (See
xref::combat-phase.adoc#moving-chargers[Moving Chargers]).

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.Infantry move through a gap – this is allowed so long as the gap is at least 20mm wide. The unit has been moved into a column – but stands could equally well be placed into a line or in irregular formation within the defile.
image::movement/move-through-gap.png[id=move-through-gap]

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.This infantry unit cannot move through the gap between the two enemy units. A gap between enemy or between enemy and impassable terrain must be wider than a stand’s front for it to pass through.
image::movement/cannot-move-through-gap.png[id=cannot-move-through-gap]

=== Terrain

It is well known fact that terrain features radically affect
strategy, providing strong points to defend as well as
obstructions to movement.

*Infantry* can move into or over terrain features with no
reduction to their movement distance.

*Cavalry* and monsters can’t move into or over terrain
features on the battlefield except for hills, bridges,
shallow fordable rivers, grown fields and low obstacles
(hedges, walls, fences or ditches, for example).

*Chariots and artillery* cannot move into or over terrain
features on the battlefield except for hills and bridges.

*Machines* have special rules but in general treat terrain
in the same way as chariots.

There are rules in the rulebook and army lists referring
to some terrain features as a *dense terrain*. A *dense
terrain* imposes -1 Command penalty as described in the
Command phase section (p.15). Typical dense terrain
features are woods, built-up areas and broken or marshy
ground (for more detail see Advanced Terrain Rules p.80)

Any other feature large enough to warrant representation
on the tabletop is considered to form a barrier to cavalry,
chariot, monster, machine and artillery movement
(unless players choose to agree otherwise before the
game).

Hills can be moved over by all troops if they are
essentially open and quite shallow but steep, rock strewn
or wooded hills are considered impenetrable to all units
except infantry.

In some exceptional cases, terrain might be considered
a barrier to all troops, including infantry as well as
cavalry, etc. Obvious examples include a huge canyon,
a lake of molten lava, the ocean or an especially large
river. These are unusual and entertaining features but
don’t really enter into the majority of games, so we won’t
concern ourselves with them any further. If you refer to
the Advanced Terrain Rules section you’ll find further
examples of rules for unusual terrain.

Rules occasionally oblige units to move into terrain they
cannot cross. If units attempt to move into terrain they
cannot cross they will halt at the edge. If they are *driven
back* into impassable terrain as a result of shooting or
magic, they may become *confused* (see the Shooting
phase section (p.27) and the Confusion section). If a
unit is forced to retreat into impassable terrain during
combat, then stands may be destroyed as a result (see the
Combat phase section p.45-46).

=== Fortifications and buildings

High walls, tall towers and large buildings block
movement as you might reasonably expect. In these
cases, troops must move through gateways or gaps. The
exception to this is flying troops and this is covered in
detail in the section on Flying Units.

The only time when ground troops can move across
an intact curtain wall, tower or similar fortification is
when infantry are making an assault as described in the
chapter Siege & Fortresses on p.87. Assaulting troops
come prepared with scaling ladders, grappling hooks,
siege towers and a hefty dose of grim determination.

image::movement/knights.png[]

== Moving by initative

The Initiative rule represents the ability of a unit’s
commanding officer to lead his troops to the attack or
guide them away from danger. Once the enemy is close,
a regiment’s training and natural instincts pretty much
determine what happens next, regardless of what the
General might prefer.

During the Initiative Movement section of the Command
phase, a unit can use its own initiative to either charge or
evade from the closest visible enemy unit within 20cm.
It does not have to do so, and can instead wait until the
Ordered Movement section of the Command phase
and attempt to move by means of an order as usual.
The choice is the player’s in most cases; exceptions are
covered in the army lists.

A unit is assumed to be able to see another if it is possible
to draw an uninterrupted line of sight between the *front*
edge of any stand and any stand in the other unit. It is
not possible to see through unit stands from either side,
or terrain other than low features such as low obstacles,
rivers/streams etc. Characters never block line of sight
(see the Generals, Wizards and Heroes section).

Individual units that wish to move by initiative must
move *before* any orders are issued. Once an order has
been given by a character, no more units can move using
initiative. A unit that used initiative to move *can’t* be
given orders that turn.

A unit moving by initiative can move in one of two ways.
It can *charge* the closest enemy unit that it can see within
20cm or it can *evade* away from the closest enemy unit
that it can see within 20cm. If you want a unit to do
something else, such as move around a flank or attack an
enemy other than the closest, then you will have to issue
an order instead.

Units moving by initiative do so during the Initiative
Movement section of the Command phase as already
explained (above and see p.13). Units are moved one at a
time, the movement of each is completed before moving
the next, but the player can move the units in whatever
order he wishes. Because units are moved one at a time,
it is possible for a unit to move so that it blocks the line of
sight of another friendly unit, making it either impossible
for that unit to use initiative or changing which visible
enemy unit is closest. Conversely, a unit’s move could
open a line of sight, allowing another friendly unit to
use its own initiative or changing which enemy unit is
closest. See <<initiative-charge-1>> and <<initiative-charge-2>>.

If two or more enemy units are equally close a player
may choose which to charge or evade. Refer to the
Combat phase section (p.34- 38) for rules for charges.

Some units can see all round – they have 360 degree
vision – and you will find this indicated in the unit’s
description (for example, Wolf Riders in the Orc army).

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.Unit A is within 20cm of Enemy 1 and can see – it uses Initiative to charge. Note unit B cannot see any enemy in this position.
image::movement/initiative-charge-1.png[id=initiative-charge-1]

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.Now unit A has moved unit B can see enemy 2, and can use its Initiative to charge – unit A’s move has opened a line of sight for unit B to charge.
image::movement/initiative-charge-2.png[id=initiative-charge-2]

This simply means a line of sight can be drawn from any
free edge of any stand in the unit to any stand of another
unit. This can potentially enable such a unit to use its
initiative to evade from an enemy positioned to its side
or rear. However, note that even a unit that can see all
round cannot charge an enemy unless a line of sight can
be drawn from a stand’s front edge.

Artillery cannot use their initiative to charge, although
they can use it to evade. The crews of artillery, such as
cannons or stone throwers have no natural inclination
and little ability to fight in close combat.

Enemy infantry or artillery in fortified positions can be
ignored when it comes to using initiative – these units
are considered either unable to move or unlikely to do
so. A player can choose to ignore such enemy units if he
wishes, in which case his own unit can use initiative to
charge or evade the closest non-fortified enemy within
20cm.

A unit can also ignore the presence of enemy units if
they are divided by a mutually impassable barrier so long
as neither the unit itself nor the enemy unit(s) can move
round the barrier within a full pace move. For example,
cavalry cannot cross rivers, so two cavalry units divided
by a river can ignore each other for purposes of initiative.
A player can choose to ignore such enemy units if he
wishes, in which case his own unit can use initiative to
charge or evade the closest visible enemy unit within
20cm that is not divided by the impassable barrier.

=== The path of evaders

When troops evade, they move directly away from the
closest enemy they can see up to their full pace move,
by at least 1 cm. When we say ‘directly away’ or, for that
matter, ‘directly towards’, the direction is established by
placing a tape measure between the closest points of the
closest two opposing stands. Where stands are equally
close, the evading player may choose between them. The
resulting line indicates the exact direction in which the
evaders move. See <<evade-direction>>.

image::movement/anvil.png[]

Move the evading unit one stand at a time. First, move
the evading stand that is closest to the enemy. This stand
must move in a straight line in the indicated direction
directly away from the evaded enemy. The stand can be
oriented to face any direction during its move allowing
the evaders to move through gaps, turn to face their
enemy, or change the stand‘s final facing. Move the
rest of the stands one stand at a time and arrange them
into the unit‘s new formation. Remember to take into
account any necessary distance required to reorient
stands as they move.

// TODO: Low-priority diagram text
.The evaders move in a line established by placing a tape measure between the closest points of the closest stands – in this case A and B.
image::movement/evade-direction.png[id="evade-direction"]

.Optional rule
****
*Light Cavalry:* a Cavalry unit with 6+ Armour can
evade in any direction, not just directly away from
the enemy. Note that it is still obliged to move in a
straight line when evading.
****

Evading units cannot move through terrain they could
not normally enter, nor through enemy units or combat
engagements. An evading unit must end its move at least
5cm from any enemy unit or any unit engaged in combat.
If unable to comply, units cannot evade.

An evading unit can move through a friendly unengaged
unit if the player wishes assuming the evaders have
sufficient move to pass completely through. This is called
a *burst through* and is an exception to the normal rule that
units can’t move through each other. The burst through
represents a situation where trained troops in good order
manoeuvre through each other, one unit opening up its
ranks to allow the other to pass. See <<evade-burst-through>>. This
obviously takes time, so a unit which is burst through is
automatically *confused*! See the Confusion section (p.55).

=== Character movement

Characters move at the end of the Command phase after
unit movement has been completed. Characters never
move with units during the Command phase, not even
if a character joined a unit in a previous turn or if such
a unit charges or evades using initiative. When units are
repositioned during other phases, during pursuit combat
for example, characters which have joined units are
moved with them.

Each character can move once and up to 60cm, or 100cm
if flying. Characters can always move at full pace and,
unless mounted on a monstrous mount or riding a
chariot, always treat terrain as if they were infantry. No
Command test is required for a character to move. Any
failed Order rolls made in the Command phase do not
affect his ability to move.

Due to their unique role in Warmaster, characters are
treated differently to other types of units. Character
stands are essentially ‘tokens’ that are considered to
be ‘transparent’ on the battlefield. In other words, this
means they can move through units from their own
side, and similarly, a unit can move through its own
side’s characters. All stands from either side can see past
and, if they are appropriately armed, can shoot through
characters as if they were not there.

See the Generals, Wizards and Heroes section (p.59).

== Units which move off the table

Sometimes units or characters are obliged to move
off the table. This can happen when a unit receives a
‘blundered’ order but can also happen to units that are
defeated in combat or troops driven back by missile fire
or magic.

If one or more stands in a unit leaves the table edge,
whether wholly or partially, the whole unit leaves the
table. Units that leave the table as a result of retreating
from combat are deemed destroyed. In any other
situation roll a D6 and then consult the table below to
see what happens. Deduct -1 from the roll for each of the
unit’s stands that has already been removed as a casualty
and apply the result immediately.

[cols="^,<"]
|===
|D6 |Result

|0 or less
|The unit/character leaves the battlefield and
does not return. The unit/character is
considered to have been destroyed.

|1-2
|The unit/character leaves the battlefield and
may or may not reappear. At the start of its
side’s next turn, before initiative moves are
made, roll again on this chart.

|3-4
|The unit/character reappears at the table edge
at the same point it left. The unit/character
cannot move further that turn.

|5-6
|The unit/character reappears at the same
point on the table edge it left from. If it is
reappearing at the beginning of a turn, it may
move as normal.
|===

When a unit reappears on the table it must retain the
same formation and face the same direction as when it
left the table.

Characters who move off the table with units they have
joined suffer the same fate as the unit. Characters who
are on their own must roll in the unlikely event that they
leave the table.

If a General leaves the table (for whatever reason) and
does not return immediately then the battle is over and
his army withdraws. He abandons his army and heads
for the hills and is considered to be a casualty. See the
End of the Battle section.
