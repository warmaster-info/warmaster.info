== Setting up armies

There are several different but equally acceptable
ways of setting up armies for a battle. In the scenarios
it is often specified which side deploys first or how the
units are deployed. However, where a game is played
without a specific scenario or a scenario is played where
no deployment is specified, players can deploy in any
mutually agreeable fashion. The following are commonly
used and provide an evenhanded way of deploying.

image::battlefields/boar-chariot.png[]

*One unit at a time.* Each side deploys one unit at a time
onto the table starting with the player whose army has
the most units. If both armies are the same size roll a
dice to decide who goes first. Once one player has no
units left, his opponent places the rest of his units on
the battlefield. Characters are placed once all units are
in position, either all at once or one at a time in the same
way as units.

*Maps.* Each player makes a sketch map of his table edge
and draws the positions of his units and characters. Once
both players have completed their maps they are placed
on the table and the armies are deployed by each player
in accordance with the position indicated.

*Screens.* A screen is set up across the centre of the table
and each player sets up his army out of sight of the other.
Once both armies are deployed the screen is removed
and the dispositions revealed.

*One side first.* Both players roll a dice and the highest
scoring player decides whether to set up first or second.
One side then sets up its entire army first, then the other
side sets up. The side that sets up first, decides who takes
the first turn.

*Scouts.* This way of setting up the armies is described in
detail <<scouting,below>>.

== Setting up scenery

It is entirely up to the players to decide on how to set
up the scenery before the armies deploy. However, we
recommend you use between 6 and 10 significant scenery
pieces, evenly distributed across the table. Here are some
ways on how to set up your scenery.

*Dice for Edges.* Both players help to construct the
battlefield, after which they roll a dice to see which table
edge they fight from. As neither player knows which
edge he will start from, it is in their interest to make a
battlefield that is reasonably balanced.

*One player sets up and his opponent chooses which
edge to fight from.* One player sets up the terrain and
the other decides which of the opposing edges he will
fight from. This is a good method when one player is
travelling to another’s house as it enables the host to set
up the scenery beforehand.

*Symmetrical set up.* The scenery is laid out perfectly
symmetrically so that no advantage is conferred to either
side. This is a bit mechanical and rather unrealistic but
it’s certainly fair in principle.

== Table size and deployment areas

// Metric dimensions added
Warmaster has been developed for [.edit]#1.8×1.2m# (6′×4′) gaming tables. It
can be played on a slightly smaller or much larger table
using suitably sized forces. Armies need about 20cm of
depth hence the standard game rule is that armies deploy
along opposite table edges 80cm apart.

[#scouting]
.Scouting
****
Scouting rules are an alternative way deploying
your armies. It represents the pre-battle struggle for
information between opposing armies’ scouts, and their
commanders carrying out personal reconnaissance.

Before the game starts, players must indicate on their
army lists which units and/or characters they wish to
commit to scouting. Using the table below count the
total number of committed scouting points.

[cols="1,^2,4",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Role |Scouting Points |Troop Types

|Flyers
|3
|flying unit or any flying character or character on flying mount; Rangers; Gutter
Runners; Gorgers; Waywatchers

|Scouts
|2
|any unit of cavalry with 6+ Armour; Ethereal Hosts; Centigors; Warhounds;
Huntsmen; Beastherd/Herdkin deployed as ambushers; Skirmishers; non-flying
General

|Patrols
|1
|any unit of cavalry with zero or 5+ Armour; Rat Swarms; Skinks;
non-flying command 8 character.
|===

Each player then rolls 2D6 and adds this to their number
of committed scouting points. The player with the higher
total chooses the table side and places his committed
scouting units and/or characters within deployment
zone. Units which are allowed to infiltrate or ambush do
not need to be placed at this stage. Scouts and Patrols that
are an addition to units (such as Empire Skirmishers)
have to be placed at this stage with the rest of the unit.

// Paragraph break added
Next the player with the lower total must place all of
his units and characters within his deployment zone.

// Paragraph break added
Finally, the player who ‘won’ the scouting roll then
places the remainder of his units in his deployment zone
and must move second in the first turn.

== How long does the battle last?

There are several ways to determine how long the battle
will last. Here are some of them described in detail.
In any case the battle ends when one side concedes or
withdraws.

*Unlimited time.* Players may prefer to play a battle
without any fixed end. In such cases the battle ends when
one side concedes or withdraws because their General is
slain, or their break point is reached.

*Agreed on beforehand.* Players may simply agree on the
number of turns before the game begins.

*Random length decided beforehand.* Roll a dice and
consult the table below to see how long the battle will
last.

[cols="^1,^2",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|D6  |Game Length

|1–2 |5 turns
|3–4 |6 turns
|5–6 |7 turns
|===

*Random length.* At the end of the 5th turn, roll a dice. On
the roll of 4+ the battle ends. Otherwise repeat the roll
on the end of the next turn. The game definitely ends at
the end of the 8th turn.

*Time limit.* Apart from the number of turns, the length
of the game can be set by a time limit. If no side breaks
when the time limit is reached, then the side with the
most victory points is the winner. Alternatively the
death clock can be used, in which case the side that runs
out of time first is the loser.

== Scenarios

The simplest way to start a game is by lining the
armies up across the battlefield 80cm apart using one
of the methods described. Although easy, this seems
unnecessarily dull when you could embellish each battle
with its own story. So why not have a go. The following
scenarios present examples of how battles can be fought.
You can play these exactly as they are, or you can change
the objectives and other details to suit yourselves. There
are no rules when it comes to creating a battle. It’s up to
you to invent an entertaining plot or spin a fantastic yarn
to underpin the game.

== Victory Points

Victory Points in following scenarios are designed so
they fit into the campaign system presented further in
this Rulebook. In these scenarios the Victory Points are
not related to the point costs of the units destroyed but
purely to the scenario objectives.

As usual, the player with the most Victory Points is the
winner. To see how decisive the victory was, consult the
Victory Points difference with the following table:

[cols="^,^",frame=ends,grid=rows]
|===
|1–2 Victory Points |Minor victory
|3–5 Victory Points |Major victory
|6+ Victory Points  |Massacre
|===

If both sides have an equal number of Victory Points,
then the game is a draw.

== Take and hold

The aim of this scenario is to fight over certain objectives
rather than just breaking your opponent. The battle
can be played at any number of points however we
recommend 2000 or more.

== Special Rules

After terrain is set, players take turns in placing four
game objectives. These can be any kind of markers or
preferably some terrain features, such as buildings, lone
trees, shrines etc. Two of the objectives should be placed
15cm within the central table line (objective zone B).
Place the remaining two objectives outside this zone as
well as outside the deployment zones (objective zone A).
In each objective zone A there should be one objective.
Place the objectives at least 5cm from any dense terrain
and at least 30cm from each other.

After the objectives are placed, roll for sides and deploy
your armies within the deployment zones.

== Victory Points

Victory Points are awarded not only for breaking the
opponent but for holding the objectives during the game.
Victory Points for holding an objective are scored if a
non-confused unit is within 5cm of the objective while
there is no enemy unit within 5cm of the same objective
at the end of player’s turn from 3rd turn on. Flyers cannot
hold objectives however, they can contest them. Number
of awarded points depends on where the objective lies

*1 point* for holding the objective on your side of the table.

*2 points* for holding an objective on the enemy side of
the table.

*2 points* for forcing the enemy to withdraw.

Game ends when one player collects 10 Victory Points,
one side withdraws or in a pre-agreed way (see <<how-long-does-the-battle-last>>).

An army that withdrew cannot win but draw at best
even when it has more Victory Points than the enemy.

== Battle for the tower

This scenario features a bloody struggle for a tower
positioned in the middle of the battlefield. The battle
can be played at any number of points however we
recommend 2000 or more.

=== Special Rules

Along with other terrain, place a tower (or any similar
significant terrain feature such as farm house, monolith,
shrine etc.) right in the middle of the table. This terrain
feature counts as impassable terrain.

Deploy your armies as usual.

A player controls the tower if at least two of their non
confused units of infantry, cavalry or chariots (in any
combination) are touching the tower and are not in
combat, and no enemy unit is touching the tower.

== Victory points

// Spelling important, controls
It is important who controls the tower no matter
which side withdrew. From 3rd turn on, a player will
be awarded Victory Points at the end of his turn if he
controls the tower. Amount of awarded points depends
on following situation:

*3 points* for controlling the tower.

*1 point* extra if there is no enemy unit within 10cm of
the tower.

*1 point* extra if there is no enemy unit within 20cm of
the tower. This bonus stacks with the
previous one.

*2 points* for forcing the enemy to withdraw.

Game ends when one player collects 10 Victory Points,
one side withdraws or in a pre-agreed way (see <<how-long-does-the-battle-last>>).

An army that withdrew cannot win but draw at best
even when it has more Victory Points than the enemy.

== Defending the village

In this scenario one player is the defender defending
a village and farmsteads against the attacker’s army
raiding the country. The attacker’s aim is to burn down
as many of the buildings as possible, while the defender
is trying to prevent this from happening. The scenario is
designed for 2000 point armies.

=== Special Rules

Along with the other terrain, place a village in the
defender’s corner. The village should be approximately
20cm×20cm. Next players take turns in placing four
buildings starting with the attacker. Two buildings are
placed 10cm from the diagonal axis on the attacker’s half
of the table (line A on the diagram). Two other buildings
are placed 20cm from the axis on the defender’s side (line
B on the diagram).

The attacker deploys first in his deployment zone (see
the diagram below). The defender then deploys, and goes
first.

Any stand from an attacker’s unit of infantry (non-
flying), cavalry or chariots that is not in combat or
confused, and is touching a building can try and set it on
fire by rolling a 6 in the combat phase. Once the building
is on fire, it is deemed to have been burned down. The
village counts as one model for this purpose.

The game ends when one side withdraws or in a pre-
agreed way (see <<how-long-does-the-battle-last>>).

=== Victory Points

Victory Points are gained for defending and destroying
the buildings, depending which role the army had.

// Spelling 2 points
*2 points* for breaking the enemy.

*1 point* for the attacker for every burnt building on the
line A.

*2 points* for the attacker for every burnt building on the
line B.

*3 points* for the attacker for burning the village.

*1 point* for the defender for defending the village.

*2 point* for the defender for every unburnt building on
the line B.

*3 points* for the defender for every unburnt building on
the line A.

A broken army cannot win the game. It can either lose
or draw.

== Wagon train

A supply wagon train escorted by a patrol force is
suddenly ambushed by the enemy. The defenter’s task is
to protect and get to safety as many wagons as possible.
The attacker’s aim is to destroy the wagons and loot
them for bounty. The scenario is designed for 2000 point
armies.

=== Special Rules

Along with the other terrain place a road running
through the middle of the table. The defender places 6
wagons on the road so that no wagon is more than half
the way across the table and no closer than 40cm to the
defender’s side of the table (see diagram). Then the rest of
the defender’s army is deployed within their deployment
zone. Then the attacker deploys. The defender goes first.

Wagons can move 20cm once in the Command phase,
heading in the direction leading away from the defender’s
side of the table. They don’t need to be given orders to do
this. Alternatively they can be given individual orders, in
which case they can move once 20cm along the road in
whatever direction you wish, or 10cm cross country. A
wagon can’t be given two or more orders in a turn. Any
that leave the table by any edge are counted as having
been saved. Wagons cannot be driven back by missile
fire.

// Spelling 'its own'
The wagons can be just destroyed or destroyed and
looted. The wagon is destroyed when at least one attack
(shooting, magic or close combat) is inflicted. A unit in
contact with a wagon cannot attack it if it is engaged
in close combat. To loot a wagon an enemy unit must
destroy it and remain in touch with it until its own
Command Phase. Only infantry and cavalry can loot
wagons.

Game ends when one side withdraws or in a pre-agreed
way (see <<how-long-does-the-battle-last>>).

=== Victory Points

*2 points* for breaking the enemy.

*1 point* for the attacker for every wagon destroyed in
close combat.

*3 points* for the attacker for every wagon destroyed and
looted. However, a unit that looted a wagon must survive
the battle to yield the points.

*1 point* for the defender for every non destroyed wagon.

*3 points* for the defender for every wagon saved.

Broken army cannot win the game. It can either lose or
draw.
