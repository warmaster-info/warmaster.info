= Siege & Fortresses

== Introduction

In the game of Warmaster it is possible to represent
fortresses, walls, towers, castles and even entire cities
on the tabletop by means of appropriately sized models.
The scale of the game is ideally suited to fighting
massive sieges with sweeping armies, mighty fortresses,
lumbering war machines and towering engines of
destruction.

In our Siege game system defenders and attackers will
have to pay points for each part of fortification and
Siege equipment and of course for their units, so that in
the end it will be possible to play balanced Siege games
with equal chances for all sides. Within those rules it
should also be possible to play scenarios with only small
fortifications (like a watchtower, a traveller’s inn or a
cemetery) without giving the defender too much of
an advantage. It is a fact that big Sieges usually lasted
weeks or even years. But knowing that many players
prefer single session, pickup games, we tried to include
actions like bombardments etc. into one playing session.
That does not mean that Siege Campaigns should not be
supported by these rules. But we intended to make it
possible to play easy, uncomplicated pick up Siege games
(especially as we think Warmaster is the perfect scale for
them). Special scenarios or campaigns might still follow.

== Model fortresses

Walls, castles and towers can be made from card, plastic,
balsa or similar materials. The small scale of Warmaster
models means that it is relatively easy to produce a
fortress using readily obtainable items. For example,
plaster of paris and plasticine can be used to create
wall sections, towers and even gateways. However, the
easiest material to use is thick card, such as the mounting
card commonly sold for picture framing.

When making walls or towers for a castle or fortress
where troop stands will be deployed it is necessary to
make sure that the walkways are sufficiently wide
enough to take a stand (i.e., 20mm). Similarly, it is also
a good idea to make sure that such things as bridges,
gateways and roads between buildings are at least 20mm
wide so that stands can move along them. The following
Siege rules very much depend on dividing the fortress in
sections between 40 to 50mm, so building a castle you
should consider either making sections of this width or
at least think of a way of marking those sections.

== General siege rules

Generally in siege scenarios the Breakpoint for both
armies is ignored. The game will only end when either
one of the generals dies or when the turn limit for the
scenario expires. Occasionally a scenario will state
otherwise, in this instance the specific scenario rules
take precedence over this.

When deciding to play a siege game always let the
defender pay the points for his units, fortifications and
siege equipment first then the attacker may spend the
same amount of points on his troops and/or equipment
according to the scenario description.

Additionally, the defending army always rounds up its
max level to the next highest level of min/max if it is not
a round figure. For example, a 1500 points army would
use the min levels for a 1000 points army, but the max
levels of a 2000 points army. This represents the higher
number of well trained troops, artillery and equipment
that you tend to find in most fortifications. This will
again always be the case in any siege scenario, unless the
specific scenario rules state otherwise.

When rules refer to a wall, it is referring to a wall section
being between 40 and 50mm wide. When it refers to a
tower, it generally includes the entirety of the tower as
defined in the Warmaster rulebook as well as the rules
that follow.

== Movement

High walls, tall towers and substantial tall buildings are
considered to block the movement of all but flying units.
Troops are therefore obliged to use gateways, doors or
gaps when moving into or out of fortresses.

Only infantry and artillery can man the ramparts of
a fortress. Cavalry, chariots, monsters, machines and
infantry based in the same way as cavalry cannot move
onto ramparts.

Infantry and artillery stands can move up, onto, or off
the defender’s side of ramparts as normal. It is assumed
there are sufficient internal stairs or ladders to enable
them to do so regardless of what the fortress model
may look like. Vertical distance is ignored as far as unit
formation is concerned.

Wall sections or towers work like extensions of bases
standing upon it. If more than half of a base is on a wall
section its control area extends to the ends of this section
as long as the area is not yet occupied. When it comes
to shooting distances, those may be measured from the
edge of the occupied section. This also means that enemy
troops may attack or evade from occupied wall sections
by initiative.

Up to four units being placed on wall-sections and/or
towers directly next to each other may be moved as a
brigade (even if the units themselves do not touch each
other). That also includes units in the courtyard that
touch the appropriate sections. The reason for this is that
room inside a fortress can be quite packed, so with this
rule it still should be possible to rearrange troops. This
means i.e. that a unit inside a tower may change place
with a unit standing on the neighbouring rampart with
only one command (even
if they are not touching each other – it is sufficient that
the building sections touch). Keep in mind that units in
fortified sections only have half movement.

// Moved to end of paragraph
image::siege-and-fortresses/moon.webp[]

Infantry stands that are from an attacking force can
move over a wall and onto unoccupied ramparts as long
as they are equipped with ladders or similar to scale
the walls. Infantry can also use a siege tower to move
directly onto a rampart. From there they may be ordered
to move on.

In most cases attackers will be forced to fight defending
troops before they are able to move onto the ramparts.
This is explained further under Assaults.

== Shooting

Fortress walls, towers and gateways are pretty solid.
Arrows and light shot will bounce harmlessly off.
They can only be damaged by shots from cannons and
stone throwing engines such as Rock Lobbers. The
Empire Steam Tank, the Helblaster Cannon or Dwarf
Gyrocopters which fire a hail of small calibre cannon
balls are unsuitable for breaching walls. Undead Skull
Chukkas are assumed to be able to throw stones in the
same way as an Orc Rock Lobber.

To breach a wall or gateway or collapse a tower you must
shoot at it with a unit of suitable artillery or machines.
Each 40 to 50mm long section of wall counts as a separate
target. A tower is considered a single target unless it is
very large (more than 50mm base area), in which case it
must be divided into a suitable number of sections in the
same way as a castle wall.

When shooting at a wall, gate or tower it is not necessary
to shoot at the closest target, as is normally the case
with missile fire, as the besiegers will generally pick a
vulnerable point beforehand and concentrate their fire
at that. If a player wishes to shoot at fortifications he can
ignore the normal targeting rules and may shoot where
he wants to within the normal limitations of range and
sight.

If you wish to shoot at troops on ramparts of walls or
towers then the normal shooting rules apply and no
account is made of damage on the wall or tower itself.
Shots that are directed at the rampart can only cause
harm to the troops and not to the fortification.

As fortresses are difficult to damage, a wall, gateway or
tower counts as fortified (6 to hit) but has no armour.

Units on ramparts and towers can shoot overhead
friendly troops on the ground.

== Structure tests

To resolve the effect of hits on a wall, gate or tower
first roll to hit as normal. At the end of the shooting
phase take a D6 for every hit the building took this
round, add all destruction dice from earlier rounds and
make a Structure Test. If the result is higher than the
Structure Resistance of the building it is destroyed (a bit
similar to a drive back roll – without the movement of
course). If the building was not destroyed the attacker
may add another Destruction Dice. So for every round
of successful shooting a maximum of one destruction
dice may be added. Those destruction dice stay until the
fortification is destroyed or the game ends. If there are
destruction dice on a building it has to make a structure
test at the end of every opponent shooting phase even if
it took no hits in the current round.

_**Example:** Brognak, the orcish leader lets his two Rock
lobbers shoot at the gateway of the city of Hundstadt
he is besieging. The results are 1–3–4–6–6–6. As any piece
of fortification counts as fortified, Brognak has hit three
times. The gate has 12 structure points, so the Orc player
makes a structure test with three dice and needs to roll
a 13: 2–3–6! 11 is not enough for destroying the gate, so
it is marked with one destruction dice for a round of
successful shooting. Next round Brognak only rolls one
6, so even with the one destruction dice from the last
round 2 D6 will not be enough to break the gate. After
5 rounds of shooting the gate still stands but there are 4
destruction dice on it. This round no 6 at all is rolled and
Brognak already thinks of biting the gate open with his
own teeth. No destruction dice is added for this round but
still there are 4 destruction dice on the gate so a structure
test has to be done before (this representing the serious
structural damage the gate has already taken). 3–3–4–5: 15!
The gate cracks at last and the orcish troops rush to the
gap to take the city._

Once a wall is breached the entire 40 to 50mm long
section is destroyed and collapses. Any stand on the
rampart is destroyed. Where practical, the wall section
can be removed and replaced by rubble or, if you wish,
by a specially made section of a breached wall.

Once a gateway is breached, the gate is assumed to have
been blown apart. A stand on a rampart above the gate is
not affected as it is the gate that is the target rather than
the surrounding stone.

As with walls, any stand on the rampart and inside a
tower is destroyed when it collapses. Where practical,
the tower should be replaced with model rubble to show
that it has collapsed.

== Battering

Walls, towers and gates can also be breached by means
of Battering Rams or similar. First the battering unit
‘charges’ the targeted part of the fortification by
initiative or order. The defending units on the ‘battered‘
and the directly adjacent sections may use their missiles
or boiling oil according the normal assault rules, which
means that if the battering unit loses one stand the assault
is failed and the assaulting unit has to retreat 1cm for
each hit they have taken. If not the battering unit may
ignore the defending troops to batter the structure. Each
ram automatically inflicts one hit in the shooting phase.
At the end of the shooting phase a structure test is made
for the particular piece of fortification (see Structure
Tests). Of course the particular wall may not be shot at
when assaulted by a battering unit (as the battering unit
is in the way) but adjacent wall sections may be shot at.

If the wall or gate fails the test it collapses. So in the
following combat phase the battering unit may proceed
as if it had destroyed their first unit in combat and may
fall back or advance. In case of an advance the battering
unit may ignore fortified troops in this particular case as
it storms into the courtyard. Touching units on ramparts
are not taken in account during the following combat as
this fight happens on different height levels.

In the case of destroyed gateways, the defending units
above may not use their boiling or similar attacks against
the battering unit anymore as they already have, but they
may use them against following units that try to enter
the gateway.

If the structure is not destroyed by the battering attack
add another destruction dice and fall back 10 cm with
the battering unit.

Giants can also batter a wall with their clubs but no
other monster is sufficiently large to do so.

_**Example:** One tower seems to be especially resistant.
Although the orcish rock lobbers fired load after load
at the solid stone building it still did not show any sign
of weakness. So Brognak orders his strongest giant to
batter the walls of the tower and to his surprise the giant
follows the order. Of course the tower may not be shot
at anymore as the giant is “in the way” but there are 8
destruction dice on it so at the end of the shooting phase
a structure test has to be made. Results are 6–6–5–5–4–3–2–1
which is more than the 30 structure points the tower has.
The tower collapses before the surprised giant and he is
allowed to advance into the next enemy he can see._

== Breaches

When a breach is caused, either by the destruction of a
wall section, or that of a tower, you should remove the
relevant part of the fortification that has been destroyed
(if possible) and replace it with a suitable marker or
model.

In certain cases you will find that a breach caused in a
wall or tower will destroy stands from a unit, possibly
even destroying a stand in the middle of the unit, which
would normally not be possible due to the Removing
Casualties rules.

In that case count the number of wounds the lost stand
had and proceed as if the unit would have taken that
many wounds by shooting. So a unit with three hits
discounts two because of being fortified but the attacker
may roll the last dice to determine driveback and the
defender may still choose which stand he removes
according to normal rules (even if that means that an
intact wall section is left unguarded and a stand is put
into the breach). The unit is driven back directly away
from the wall no matter from where the shooting has
been coming from.

Units attacking units in a breach are not drawn into
combat with any units on adjacent standing wall sections.
The reverse is also the case, in that troops assaulting a
wall section do not count as attacking troops in adjoining
breaches. This is one instance where corner-to-corner
contact does not count. In addition, this means that units
attacking breaches or wall sections in this way only have
to spread out and maximise contact with adjacent troops
that are on the same level as the attacked unit.

_**Example:** The last wall section of three has been breached
by Brognak’s rock lobbers. The orc warriors charge the
stand of halberdiers that is defending the breach. On the
still intact walls a unit of crossbowmen tries to lure the
orcs to fight with them too, but the orcs don’t have to
spread out as the crossbowmen are on another level. If
the halberdiers would have been placed on the still intact
walls too the orcs would have been obliged to spread out
to them._

_You can, if you wish, attack or assault all of the wall
sections in question if the charging stands have enough
movement._

=== Gateways and Breaches

Walls can have entrances of two broadly different
sizes: large gateways and smaller doors or gates, such
as postern gates and sally ports. The chances are that a
model gateway won’t look wide enough for an infantry
stand to move through – but we won’t worry about that.
Just as in real life, troops will file through a door or gate
so we must assume our warriors can do the same.

Friendly units and characters can move through intact
gateways without penalty. It is assumed that they have
the wits to open it beforehand and close it behind them
once they’ve gone through. Enemy cannot move through
an intact closed gateway but must smash it down first. If
a defending unit for whatever reason ends its movement
directly in or has to retreat through the gateway while
still fighting the gate counts as open. If this unit is
destroyed in combat the victorious unit may advance
through the gate into the next visible unit. Of course the
gate may also be closed to block the retreating path of
own units if all stands of the unit are outside. It is not
allowed to close the gate if there are parts of the unit
standing in or behind the gateway.

Once a gateway in a wall is destroyed remove the
appropriate wall sector (for providing better playability).
Any units being on that sector are not destroyed but
placed directly behind the gate. It is assumed that they
hurried down from the ramparts to defend the suddenly
open entrance against any attackers.

Gateways in towers are treated differently. The attacker
has to choose if he attacks/shoots at the gateway or the
tower. If the gateway is destroyed, attackers may move
through it to attack troops behind. Units still manning
the tower above may use their shooting/rock/boiling oil
attacks in the same way as if an adjacent wall section
would have been attacked.

Any units from either side can move through it without
any reduction to their movement. Giants are assumed to
stoop if necessary!

Small doors can be moved through by friendly infantry or
cavalry and appropriate characters.Monsters, artillery,
machines and chariots cannot move through smaller
types of doors and gates. Cavalry riders are assumed to
dismount in order to lead their horses through.

Units moving through a small door or gate suffer no
reduction in their movement but a maximum of three
troop stands and any number of character stands can
go through in any Command phase (i.e., a single unit in
most cases). Enemy cannot move through small doors at
all.

Intact gateways and small doors are assumed to block
sight for the attackers. This means that an attacking unit
will not be able to move through and charge in the same
move. This is because the unit cannot see its target at
the start of its move. Defenders on the other hand are
assumed to have peeping holes in doors so a defending
unit positioned directly behind a gate can see through it
as if it were not there.

A breach in a wall or collapsed tower can be moved
through by infantry, cavalry or monsters. Still any unit
trying to cross the breach has to stop there; either to fight
any defending units or to wait for another order to move
through (the area there is too difficult to just march
through). Machines, artillery and chariots, however,
cannot move over the debris at all. The wreckage caused
by a collapsing wall or tower counts as cover to defenders
in the same way as a low wall or barricade. A breach can
therefore be defended by troops on the other side once
the wall or tower itself has been knocked down.

== Assaults

It is possible for infantry to attack an enemy on the
ramparts of a fortress’ walls but not enemy on towers,
as these are too high to reach. Depending on the
construction of the model’s fortifications it may be
necessary to designate some high walls, gateways or
towers as being ‘too high to assault’. This is left to the
players’ discretion.

Infantry can also attack a rampart from siege towers
as discussed later. In both cases this is called an assault.
Only infantry can assault. Except for the odd examples
discussed later, cavalry, chariots, monsters, artillery and
machines cannot assault a fortress because they cannot
attack fortified stands. Assaults are different from
ordinary combat in several ways.

Infantry units can make an assault by charging up to
the base of the defended fortress walls. The assaulting
units do not have to form a battle line as in case of normal
charge. The two sides then fight a round of combat as if
they were touching.

include::partial$divider-sword.adoc[]

As fortress models will never exactly match the size of a
base it is necessary to adjust the normal rules concerning
base to base contact in assaults. For our rules to work it
is important that no rampart section is more than 5cm
wide.

If a wall section is assaulted, the nearest units on
adjacent wall sections may make stand and shoot attacks
(even if the units on that section do not directly touch the
attackers). And they count as being in cross contact with
the attackers in the following combat.

Units in towers are a bit different. As towers are built to
provide extra defences, all units in a tower may support
assaulted adjacent wall sections with stand and shoot
(even if they won’t be in combat afterwards due to the
higher position they have). Still they may only do that
for the adjacent wall section that was attacked first. If
the tower itself is being assaulted afterwards, units in
it may stand and shoot as normal again. Have a look at
<<f-tower-support>>.

.When unit 1 attacks B, the Cannons A on the tower, and units B and C, may Stand and Shoot. Cannons D may not Stand and Shoot as it is not the nearest unit on the wall section (and it will not be in combat contact of course). B and C will be in combat contact with 1. pass:[<br>] If unit 2 would have attacked first, Cannons A would have had their Stand and Shoot against them but not against unit 1 afterwards.
image::siege-and-fortresses/tower-support.webp[id=f-tower-support]

Towers may also use their special “Stand and Shoot”
ability against attackers with Sows, Siege Towers or
Battering Rams. But those attackers do profit from the
better armour roll their siege equipment provides. If an
assaulting unit loses a stand by shooting or boiling oil
attacks, the assault has failed and the unit retreats 1cm
for each hit taken.

During an assault, no account is made for the effect
of supporting stands for either side. In the dangerous,
cramped and confused melee of an assault it is impossible
for troops to support each other as they do on the open
battlefield. Also as units fighting on ramparts can hardly
maintain a coherent formation, there is no need for
stands to direct their attacks primarily to the front.

Missile armed defenders can shoot at troops making an
assault in the same way as at troops making a charge.
Any hits inflicted are carried over and count as if struck
in the assault.

If the attackers win the combat round, their assault has
succeeded. Beaten defenders must retreat down from
the ramparts and away from their enemy. Measure all
retreat moves horizontally. No account is made of the
distance moved up or down (otherwise a stand could
end up halfway down a wall!). Artillery stands are
automatically destroyed if forced to retreat.

Victorious units automatically move stands onto the
empty ramparts. If the unit won’t fit on the ramparts,
some stands must be left at the base of the wall. Because
combatants will be separated, the combat ends. No
pursuit combat is fought during an assault.

In the event of a draw, the combat is deemed unresolved
and carries on in the next combat phase. The assaulting
units invested too much effort to scale the walls to simply
fall back.

If the defenders win the combat then the attackers are
thrown back and must retreat in the usual manner.
The defenders remain in place. Defenders will not (and
cannot!) pursue over ramparts.

=== Counter attacks on ramparts

Once attackers have taken a fortress’ walls it is likely
that their enemies will counter charge. Stands holding
the ramparts of walls against attacks from the inner side
of the fortress do not count as being fortified. Because
of the advantage of height they count as being defended.

Sometimes it may occur, in the odd situation, that two
opposing units end their movement side by side on
adjacent ramparts with no line of sight to each other.
It seems quite impossible in this special situation to
ignore the enemy. So by way of exception it is allowed
to charge an enemy unit that’s placed directly upon the
neighbouring rampart section by initiative even if no line
of sight can be drawn. For the same reason it is allowed
to evade out of initiative, though the evasive movement
in this situation will be away from the outer wall not
away from the enemy.

If a unit upon a rampart is charged from an adjacent
tower or rampart section it is assumed that the attackers
attack in the open and get a +1 attacking bonus as they
are coming from the same level. Still only one stand may
come into combat contact and there is no support taken
in account on neither side. Units fighting this way may
be placed flank to flank to each other due to lack of
space but this should not result in any attack deductions.

In this situation, a unit defending ramparts will be
destroyed if it is defeated and obliged to retreat because
it has nowhere to go (except over the fortress wall to its
destruction). Victorious attackers automatically move
up onto the recaptured ramparts but cannot pursue over
walls. In case of a draw the combat is deemed unresolved
and carries on in the next combat phase. Defeated units
that were counterattacking from a tower can retreat
back to the tower assuming there is still room.

_**Example:** Chaos Ogres managed to take three rampart
sections. At the one end of the rampart there’s a tower
manned by Bowmen. At the other end there are further
rampart sections with a unit of Spearmen guarding
them. In the next round the Bowmen in the tower may
charge the Ogres out of initiative (units in towers have
360 degrees sight). The Spearmen on the other flank also
may charge out of initiative although they have no direct
line of sight (this is an outspoken exception to the basic
Warmaster rules and only affects combat on ramparts)._

_The Spearmen are placed flank edge to flank edge to the
Ogres as there is no room to place them straight but note
that all units attack with their full attacks as flanks are
not taken into account on ramparts._

image::siege-and-fortresses/crossbowmen.webp[]

// Spelling centimetre
_The results of the Bowmen’s four attacks are 6–6–3–2,
the Spearmen’s 6–4–3–2, the ogres save none. The Ogres
hit the Bowmen with 6–5–1–1 and the Spearmen with
6–4–3–3 (the Spearmen save none). The combat result
is 4:4 and the Ogres (losing one stand) may hold their
position while the Bretonnian troops may be placed one
centimetre away from the Ogres._

image::siege-and-fortresses/elves-planning.webp[]

== Giants

// "Warhammer" changed to "Warmaster"
Because they are so tall, Giants can attack troops on
ramparts. However, they are too heavy and clumsy
to scale the walls of a fortress and the people of the
Warmaster world have sufficient sense to build their
walls high! A Giant can just about reach sufficiently
high enough to bash any enemy on the ramparts of the
wall with his club (aka ‘large tree trunk’). Towers and
anything higher than a normal fortress wall are assumed
to be out of his reach. If your model fortifications are
such that there is doubt whether a Giant can reach them
or not then the players should ideally agree beforehand
which walls are out of reach.

A Giant can fight against a unit of enemy on the rampart
of a fortress wall but can’t pursue should the enemy
retreat. Although he can clear the ramparts of foes, he
can’t take and hold ramparts as infantry can.

Giants can use their clubs to batter in the same way as
a Battering Ram. A Giant can only do this if there are
no troops on the ramparts that he can fight, otherwise
he must fight the defenders instead. When attempting
to batter walls, each Giant inflicts one automatic hit and
damage is calculated in the same way as for Rams.

== Towers

// Mistaken paragraph break removed
Towers are usually the most important element of any
defensive structure. They are very tough to knock down
and incredibly difficult to assault, whilst providing an
ideal position to pour missile fire onto the attacking
army. A tower may only be assaulted from either the
courtyard or from the ramparts of adjacent wall sections.
This is because a tower is generally much too high to
assault with even the
longest ladders or tallest siege towers, so the only way in
is through the doors.

The number of stands that a tower can hold is determined
by its base area. The standard tower as defined in the
defenders fortification list has around 40–50mm edge
length and may hold up to three stands or at least one
unit of troops (but not more than two units). Towers
with more edge length cost double points and may hold
up to 3 units but no more than 6 stands. This represents
units not only being positioned on the roof of the tower,
but all throughout its height, probably stationed at gun
ports or arrow slits.

Free-standing lone towers only have one facing that can
be attacked in this way. Whichever facing this is must be
declared by the defender before the start of the battle.
This facing is assumed to be the one with the door in,
whether it is on ground level, high up with a removable
ladder.

Towers that are part of bigger fortifications are assumed
to have an entrance at every facing and level linked
to another fortress section. So towers always have an
entrance to the courtyard and to each rampart that
touches them no matter if the actual model has one
displayed.

Missile units in towers count as having a 360° fire arc.
This means that they will all have to target the closest
eligible enemy unit to the tower if they wish to fire
their missile weapons. Distances are measured from the
edges of the tower. In addition to this, all missile units
in a tower may stand and shoot at units that attack any
facing of the tower they occupy as long as the shooting
stand is not yet in combat. They may also shoot if they
are not taking the assault themselves. The only stands
that cannot do this are those that are already engaged
in combat with another unit that has charged the tower.

When assaulting a tower in this way only one stand may
attack each facing of the tower (usually only one or two
are eligible in this way). These must be from different
units and the defender may also only defend with one
stand per facing (although they must defend with
one stand on multiple facings if there are insufficient
defending stands). Defending stands never count as
being flanked.

image::siege-and-fortresses/defended-tower.webp[]

Suffering the first charge the defending stands in a tower
count as fortified. If the attacker wins the first round
of combat it is assumed that the troops could make
their way into the tower. Still attacker and defender
only fight with one stand but the attacker will get the
normal pursuit bonus. The defender still keeps on being
defended in the following rounds of combat. Defenders
of a tower can never be driven out of a tower. To put it
quite simply, you have to wipe out all the units in a tower
before you can occupy it.

In the case of a tower that holds more than one unit, the
defender chooses which unit takes the attack. Only this
unit takes all attacks until it is wiped out or the attackers
are driven off. If the tower is attacked by more than
one unit the defender may choose which unengaged
defending stand or unit takes this attack. However the
following combat will count as one big combat.

If the attacker manages to wipe out the first defending
unit he may advance once into the next defending unit
and the whole assault begins anew with the defender
being fortified.

If the attackers lose a round of combat they are placed
outside the towers’ wall as if it would have been the
front edge of the attacked unit. So a unit losing by 2 is
placed 2cm away of the attacked wall.

Other than this, all the normal rules regarding attacking
fortifications stand. For example, if by some miracle the
attacking troops do manage to wipe out all the defenders
in a tower, then they do not receive any advance charge
move. The only option available to them is to consolidate
their position and occupy the tower.

// Capital letter Sylvanian
_**Example:** Manfred von Hornberg, commander of a
lonely watchtower at the Sylvanian border is attacked
by a Vampire horde. The tower is defended by a unit of
cannons and a hellblaster cannon._

_First a unit of grave guards attacks the entrance of the
tower. They are welcomed by 8 shooting attacks from
the hellblaster and another 4 shots by the cannon. The
grave guards however only take 2 hits (one more and the
assault would have failed as the guards would have lost a
stand). Hornberg decides that a stand of the cannons has
to counter the attack. At the same time a unit of vampire
bats attacks the roof of the tower. They are shot at 8
times by the hellblaster, 2 times by the one free cannon
stand and get 3 wounds. The second stand of the cannon
counters the bats._

include::partial$divider-axe.adoc[]

_The grave guards attack 3 times and roll a total of three
6s, the bats roll another 6. The cannon wounds the guards
and the bats once. The grave guards lose one stand and
so do the bats but the cannons are destroyed. The bats
have to retreat as they are flyers so only the guards try to
go on charging the remaining hellblaster. Another round
of stand and shoot follows but the guards only lose one
wound. They attack 3 times but no 6 is rolled so the
hellblaster survives and the guards have to retreat 1 cm
out of the tower._

_Manfred von Hornberg sighs relieved, but knowing that
the worst was yet to come._

Gateway towers are exactly like all other towers with the
one exception that a gate leads through it. The gate may
be attacked on its own and the defenders manning the
gateway tower are not part of the combat that follows,
but they may use boiling oil or stand and shoot against
the attackers.

image::siege-and-fortresses/dragon-ogre.webp[]

== Flyers attacking fortifications

Flyers may attack fortified targets in the same way as
infantry, hitting on 6s with no charge bonus. They may
never occupy fortifications and thus if they win a round
of combat against troops in fortifications, they may not
pursue them for a second round of combat and may
either stand their ground, or fall back. The defenders,
however, do still have to retreat.

Flyers are unique in that they are the only units that can
actually attack units stationed in a tower without having
to do so from the courtyard or adjoining ramparts. The
normal rules for attacking towers still apply though, so
the defenders will not retreat and all the missile troops
will be able to stand and fire at the attacking flyers.

Walls, ramparts and towers are difficult terrain for
flying creatures so if they are attacked and lose a round
of combat or if they are pushed back they are destroyed.

Of course if flyers try to assault fortifications, boiling oil
attacks cannot be used against them.

== Character movement

As commanders are too valuable to risk their lives
uselessly it is not allowed for them to enter fortress
sections unless they are part of a unit. They are allowed
to be placed on unoccupied fortress sections or onto
sections that are occupied by their own troops. If a
character unit on a fortress section is touched by the
enemy units it has to join a friendly unit within 30cm.
The buildings or the height of the walls do not restrict
the movement of the character no matter if it has a flying
mount or not.

== Magic

In the process of building a fortress in fantasy worlds
magic grounding incantations are integrated, antimagic
runes are carved in the walls and magic absorbing gems
are used. So it is not possible to use magic that crosses the
ramparts or walls of a fortress.

However, it is allowed to use magic spells on units that
are assaulting a wall as well as in a combat that takes
place there. So for example an assaulting unit may get
extra attacks by “Rage of Chaos” and these extra attacks
will stay as explained in the rules even if the unit crosses
the ramparts. “Raise Dead” will also work on or even
behind the walls of the fortress as long as there is enough
room to place the raised unit and the raised unit touches
any units in combat.

== Siege machines

No besieging army would be complete without siege
towers and rams with which to pound the enemy’s
fortress to pieces. Some races have developed their own
versions of these devices but all function in more or less
the same fashion and have equal effectiveness.

Concerning Victory Points, destroyed or lost Siege
Machines immediately give the opponent their victory
points no matter if the unit carrying them is destroyed
or not.

Siege Machines like Siege Towers, Battering Rams or
Sows may use initiative to attack the nearest wall section
(towers may be ignored).

=== Siege towers

[.unit,frame=none]

|Siege tower |M |0 |3 |3+ |– |1 |20 |–/–
|===

// Spelling enemy's
A Siege Tower is a massive wooden tower that rolls
forward on huge wheels. It is pushed to the enemy’s
fortress by troops who are protected by its stout timbers.
Once the tower reaches its target, a ramp descends
allowing the sheltering troops to swarm over the walls.

// Spelling enemy's
A Siege Tower is a unique kind of machine. Its sole
purpose is to deliver troops onto the enemy’s walls. A
Siege Tower must be assigned to a unit of infantry. To
represent the fact that they are really inside the Siege
Tower, the unit is arranged directly behind in column.

image::siege-and-fortresses/siege-tower-unit.svg[id=f-siege-tower-unit]

As Siege Towers are such huge constructions the same
shooting rules apply to them as to wall sections. All
shooting enemy units within reach of Siege Towers may
choose which Tower they want to shoot at (but if they
choose to shoot at units without Siege Towers they still
have to shoot at the next visible unit).

All enemy shots against the unit are assumed to hit the
Siege Tower because the troops are actually inside it. A
Siege Tower and the unit inside it cannot be driven back
by missile fire.

Should a Siege Tower be destroyed by shooting, its
accompanying infantry will abandon it and may continue
to fight normally.

The Siege Tower has no value in close combat. If the unit
is attacked, the Tower is simply ignored. If the unit is
forced to retreat, the Siege Tower is destroyed. Units in
Siege Towers may pursue or advance in combat leaving
their machine behind which effectively means the Siege
Tower is destroyed.

The Siege Tower can be pushed forward at a speed of
15cm. As it is an incredible effort to move a massive
construction like a Siege Tower, command rolls get an
extra −1 from second command onward (so the second
command would work at a −3 instead of −2).

// Spelling immobilised
A unit accompanying a Siege Tower cannot make way
for other units. If all its accompanying infantry are killed
in combat before it reaches the walls, the Siege Tower is
considered to have been immobilised or destroyed.

Once the Siege Tower reaches the enemy’s walls it has
effectively done its job. As soon as the walls are reached,
the accompanying infantry can assault the defenders or,
if there are no defenders, they can occupy the wall as
described below.

A Siege Tower is usually not tall enough to reach a tower.
However, if there is doubt because a tower is especially
low, the players should agree before the game whether it
can be assaulted like this.

Troops making an assault from a Siege Tower cancel out
the advantage of fortifications. Both sides count as being
in the open (4+ to hit) and the assaulting stand gets the
usual +1 bonus for charging.

The assaulting unit fights with only one stand (the
warriors at the top of the Siege Tower) whilst the
defenders fight with all stands that would theoretically
be touching were it possible to move all the stands
properly into place!

include::partial$divider-sword.adoc[]

As stands touching corner-to-corner would normally
fight, defending stands adjacent to the stand directly
facing the Siege Tower will fight, assuming they are
otherwise free to do so.

Once a Siege Tower has reached the walls and is not
destroyed, up to three stands of infantry can move up
it and onto the walls in subsequent turns, assuming that
there is room for them to spread out whilst remaining
in physical contact with each other. (Once stands have
moved onto the ramparts they cannot move further that
turn, even if unopposed).

If a unit assaulting walls via Siege Tower loses the combat
and retreats 4cm or less, it still counts as being in the
tower and can assault again in the next turn. If the unit
retreats more than 4cm and the wall section it faces is
subsequently occupied by the enemy, it is automatically
destroyed. They push it over! Troops defending walls
from a counter attack cannot retreat down a Siege
Tower and enemy cannot pursue or advance using a
Siege Tower.

If the unit pushing the Siege Tower consists of missile
armed troops, all stands can shoot as if they were
positioned on top of the tower. This brings them up to
the same height as the walls. Targets on the ramparts of
walls count as being defended from a Siege Tower rather
than being fortified. Targets in higher towers still count
as being fortified.

=== Battering rams

[.unit,frame=none]
|===
|Troop |Type |Attack |Hits |Armour |Command |Unit size |Points |Min/max

|Battering ram |M |0 |3 |3+ |– |1 |10 |–/–
|===

Battering Rams are mounted on a wheeled chassis and
protected by a wooden roof so that troops inside can
push the ram forward under cover. A Battering Ram
can be incorporated into a Siege Tower in which case it
simply combines the attributes of both.

A Battering Ram’s purpose is to affect a breach in the
enemy’s gate or walls.

A Battering Ram must be assigned to a unit of infantry.
To represent the fact that they are inside the covered
frame the unit is arranged directly behind in column.
All enemy shots against the unit are assumed to hit the
Battering Ram because the troops are actually inside it.
A Battering Ram and the unit inside it cannot be driven
back by missile fire.

Should a Battering Ram be destroyed by shooting, its
accompanying infantry will abandon it and may continue
to fight normally.

The Battering Ram has no value in close combat. If
the unit is attacked, the Ram is simply ignored. If the
unit is forced to retreat, the Ram is destroyed. If units
with Battering Rams pursue or advance in combat they
leave their machine behind which effectively means it is
destroyed.

// Spelling immobilised
The Battering Ram can be pushed forward at 15cm.
A unit accompanying a Battering Ram cannot make
way for other units. If all its accompanying infantry
stands are killed before it reaches the walls, the Ram is
abandoned and is considered to have been immobilised
or destroyed.

Once the Ram reaches the enemy’s walls it can begin to
batter! The rules for battering are described above. The
Ram must be accompanied by a unit of infantry of at
least one stand in order for it to batter (they provide the
muscle). A unit may not batter and assault at the same
time.

image::siege-and-fortresses/battering-ram-unit.svg[id=fbattering-ram-unit]

=== Sows

[.unit,frame=none]
|===
|Troop |Type |Attack |Hits |Armour |Command |Unit size |Points |Min/max

|Sow |M |0 |3 |3+ |– |1 |5 |–/–
|===

These are roofed and wheeled structures that offer
protection to troops as they advance towards a castle. A
Sow is very much like a big shed on wheels or, to put it
another way, a Battering Ram without a ram. A Sow is
represented by the same rules as a Battering Ram except
that it cannot batter.

Sows have no value in close combat. If the unit is attacked
it is simply ignored. If the unit is forced to retreat,
the Sow is destroyed. Units with Sows may pursue or
advance in combat leaving their machine behind which
effectively means the Sow counts as destroyed.

image::siege-and-fortresses/sow.webp[]

=== Mantlets

These are large mobile shields made from stout wood.
They offer protection to troops behind them and can
gradually be shuffled forward without exposing the
sheltering troops to enemy fire. They are used by infantry
units and are provided with arrow slits through which
missile armed units can shoot.

In a siege game, units of infantry can have Mantlets for
+10 points per unit. This is enough to cover the unit’s
frontage and the unit is considered to be in a defended
position. If it charges, it must abandon its Mantlets. If
the unit suffers casualties, it automatically abandons any
unnecessary Mantlets (these cannot be used by other
troops). If retreating or pursuing in combat its Mantlets
are abandoned if they haven’t been already.

If a unit equipped with Mantlets is driven back by
shooting it will carry its Mantlets with it. However,
if driven back more than its half pace move (10cm for
standard infantry), the unit automatically abandons its
Mantlets as it moves. As units carrying Mantlets count
as occupying defended positions, they deduct one dice
from their drive back distance.

A unit can abandon its Mantlets at any time during the
Command phase, in which case it is not restricted to one
move that Command phase. In this case, the Mantlets are
overturned or cast aside and removed from the battle.

// Picture moved here from below
image::siege-and-fortresses/mantlets.webp[]

=== Boiling Oil or Rock Droppers

Defenders are liable to throw anything they can get
their hands on at enemies trying to scale the castle walls.
Well prepared defenders will have amassed numerous
large rocks, prodigious amounts of garbage, masonry,
furniture, statuary, dead horses, stone sinks, anvils and
the like. Of course, the professional choice is boiling oil
but scalding water and hot sand are also used to good
effect. We won’t worry much about the exact type of
missile. For our purposes it’s enough to assume that the
defenders have something appropriate to hand. For the
sake of explanation, we’ll assume that Boiling Oil is our
preferred option.

A 40 to 50mm wide section of wall may be provisioned
with Boiling oil or Rock Droppers. This may be used by
any unit of troops manning that section.

If an assault is launched against a fortress section
which is provisioned with Boiling Oil or Rock Dropper
units on this and any adjacent sections may use their
equipment against the assaulting enemy. Boiling Oil or
Rock Droppers can also be used against units making
an assault via Siege Tower or Sow but the attackers may
use the 3+ armour save of their Siege equipment instead
their own.

Note that a unit may only use one Stand and Shoot
attack. So units equipped with bows or similar have to
choose if they use Boiling Oil or their bows when they
are assaulted. They may never use both.

Boiling Oil or Rock Dropper attacks are worked out
immediately before normal combat at the same time, as
shots at chargers. A unit can pour oil or shoot with its
own weapons at the same time. Any hits inflicted are
carried over into the combat and count as having been
struck in the first round. Roll a dice and consult the chart
below.

|Tribock |Art |1/6 |4 |0 |– |1 |120 |–/1
|===

// Redundant table removed.
Shooting: Range 20–120cm, 6 Attacks

As the Tribock is such a giant machine it has to be placed
on a special stand with a front edge of 40mm and flank
edges of 60mm.

For siege use only! May not move once it is deployed.
Must be deployed before any other unit.

// Accidental paragraph removed
Shooting straight ahead: Other than normal shooting
units the Tribock has a very restricted view. It can only
draw line of sight to targets that lie in the corridor
that extends straight ahead from the front edge. So
the Tribock only has a 4cm wide corridor of sight. For
targets outside this corridor it must be ordered to turn. If
the order is failed it
does not fire that turn. Any Hits caused by the Tribock
allow no save.

Because of its immense size the Tribock has a range of
120cm but a minimum range of 20cm as the slingshot
like nature of the weapon makes it impossible to shoot
at closer targets. This obviously makes units that are
under 20cm ineligible as potential targets; thus they are
ignored as far as the rules for firing at the closest target
are concerned. The Tribock may not shoot at enemy
units that charge it.

|===

// Redundant table removed.
Shooting: Range 90cm, 4 Attacks + bounce

For siege use only! May not move once it is deployed.
Must be deployed before any other unit.

Shooting straight ahead: Other than normal shooting
units the bombard has a very restricted view. It can
only draw line of sight to targets that lie in the corridor
that extends straight ahead from the front edge. So the
bombard only has a 2cm wide corridor of sight. For
targets outside this corridor it must be ordered to turn. If
the order is failed it does not fire that turn.

Any Hits caused by the Bombard allow no save. In
addition, fortified targets only count as being defended
(5+ to hit) and defended targets count as being in the
open (4+ to hit).

The Bombards shot bounce like a normal cannon’s.
This does not apply when shooting at walls/towers as
the stonework will obviously stop the cannon ball and
prevent it bouncing. Bombards cannot shoot at charging
enemy units.

Bombards may not be used by Elves or Bretonnians.

// Redundant table removed.
Shooting: Range 20–90cm, 4 Attacks

For siege use only! Mangonels must be deployed before
any other unit and cannot move once it is deployed.

If firing it fires “straight ahead”. This means it can only
draw a line of sight to targets that lie in the corridor
that extends straight ahead from the front edge. So the
Mangonel only has a 2cm wide corridor of sight. For
targets outside this corridor it must be ordered to turn. If
the order is failed it does not fire that turn.

Any Hits caused by the Mangonel allow no save.
The Mangonel has a minimum range of 20cm as it is
impossible to adjust its mechanism to shoot at closer
target. Mangonels can’t shoot at charging enemy units.
Earthworks

image::siege-and-fortresses/mangonel.webp[]

=== Earthworks

These are defensive works built by both defending
and attacking forces in a siege and sometimes in other
situations as well. These are usually hastily constructed
out of earth, log barricades, upturned carts, barrels and
whatever else comes to hand.

Each section of earthworks purchased is 40mm long and
10mm wide, half the size of a standard Warmaster base.

Unless otherwise specified in a particular scenario,
earthworks are always deployed before the armies set
up in the relevant deployment zones, starting with the
defender deploying all his earthworks first, or dice off
to decide if for some reason there is no defined attacker
or defender. Earthworks can be arranged together in
whatever formation is desired by the purchasing player.

image::siege-and-fortresses/earthworks.webp[]

Earthworks count as a linear feature that confers
fortified status against missile fire and defended status
against any close combat attacks.

To remove earthworks to make way for your siege
towers and battering rams, a unit of infantry (and only
infantry) must be adjacent to the earthworks. If the unit
is not in combat at the beginning of the combat phase
each stand in contact with an earthwork section gets
its basic attacks against it (no charge bonuses, as what
the troops are doing is getting their entrenching tools
out). Any 6’s that are rolled will destroy the earthwork
that is attacked in this way. It is important that you
declare exactly which earthwork sections each stand is
attacking, as each 40×10mm section is effectively counted
as a separate unit for these purposes.

=== Log rams

Log rams are effectively Battering rams but without
the added protection of an armoured covering to shield
the battering unit. Log rams can be brought to bear
much more rapidly than a Battering ram can be. The
main disadvantage is, of course, the lack of protection,
especially against boiling oil poured on the battering unit
by troops on the ramparts above or stand and fire from
these units.

Attacking infantry units may be equipped with Log rams.
A unit that is equipped with Log rams may abandon its
Log rams at any point and is then unrestricted by this.
Also, when equipped with Log rams a unit may not cross
or move through any terrain which is classed as difficult
for movement purposes, such as forests or earthworks.

If a unit equipped with Log rams is driven back by enemy
shooting or magic and is forced to enter difficult terrain
it loses its log rams and moves on.

When a unit with a Log ram makes contact with a
fortress wall it will commence battering in much the
same way as a Battering ram. However, if as a result of
a boiling oil attack or stand and fire from units on the
walls enough hits are inflicted to remove a whole stand
then the battering attempt fails. For every wound the
unit has to retreat 1cm.

image::siege-and-fortresses/log-rams.webp[]

=== Ladders

Infantry units may only assault the walls of a fortress
with a siege tower or by using ladders. It costs +5 points
to equip all stands of a unit with ladders. Infantry units
based as cavalry cannot climb ladders.

image::siege-and-fortresses/ladders.webp[]

== Siege equipment lists

There are three distinct siege equipment lists; the
fortification list, the siege equipment list and the siege
artillery equipment list. These lists work in the same
way, but access to them is dependant upon the specific
restrictions of a particular scenario. The scenario special
rules will specify exactly which lists may be used by
which side.

Earthworks are available to both the attacker and the
defender, as are siege artillery.

All equipment is available to all armies of all races in
Warmaster for siege battles unless stated otherwise.
No army may ever have more than two wallbreaching
artillery per 1000 points. Remember that also cannons
and rock lobbers count as wall breaching!

=== Special rules

**†1** Only defenders are allowed to invest points into
fortification with the exception of earthworks.

**†2** The gateway may be destroyed independently with a
Structure Point value of 12. If the tower is destroyed the
gateway is destroyed with it.

**†3** Sally Gates may secretly be placed in any piece of wall
and are not revealed to the attacker until used. They may
not be targeted separately by the attacker and do not
weaken the structure of the wall (unless they are open).
One defending unit may cross the sally gate per round
either on order or initiative. For that reason a defending
unit directly touching the Sally Gate may draw a line of
sight as if it were invisible. Whenever a unit leaves or
returns by the Sally Gate the defenders need to open and
close the gates. Roll 3 dice. If the result is equal to or
more than the distance of the nearest enemy the Sally
Gate counts as open and has to be closed by a successful
command. An open Sally Gate counts as defended.

**†4** Gives fortified status when shot at, defended status if
in combat. May be removed by troops being in contact
and rolling a 6 with their attacks.

== Scenarios

=== Into the breach

‘Into the breach’ can be played on a 1.2×1.2m (4′×4′) table.

In this scenario the defender should invest about half of
his points in fortifications, but only has to pay for the
front side of the fortress i.e. the one facing the enemy.
The other sides are of no relevance.

==== Set-up

// Spelling centre
Note that the defender’s side of the table should be
essentially bare; for variety one could put up some ruins
outside the castle gate, or the remains of a farm towards
the table centre. On the attacker’s side of the table there
should be several pieces of whatever scenery is at hand.

The defender sets up first inside the defender’s zone on
the castle’s walls, on and inside the towers and gatehouse
or even outside the castle.

Attackers may set up outside 40cm of the wall, ready to
storm the castle.

There is no breakpoint for the defender, as he has
nothing to lose.

The game lasts for 7–10 rounds. At the end of the 7th turn
the game ends on roll of 4+. If it doesn’t end repeat the
same in the next turn. The game ends automatically after
10th turn is played.

The attacker has the first move.

==== Victory conditions

// Spelling/bold: neither/nor.
The attacker immediately wins if he orders one of his
units (not flyers) to move off the defender’s edge between
the two shorter castle walls. Note that the attacker can
*neither* win by breaking the defender *nor* by killing the
defenders general.

The defender wins if he breaks the attacker’s army or
kills the attacker’s general.

In all other cases the player with the most victory points
wins.

image::siege-and-fortresses/elephant-rider.webp[]

image::siege-and-fortresses/into-the-breach.svg[id=f-into-the-breach]

=== The watchtower

The Watch Tower can be played on a 1.8×1.2m (6′×4′) table
with the Attackers and Relief coming on to the table.

This scenario is played with 2000 points or less on both
sides.

The defender may use up to one quarter of his points to
defend the watchtower. At least one character has to be
part of this contingent. Up to two units may be placed in
the watchtower itself – but these units cost three times
their normal points. Any other units have to be placed
within 20cm of the watchtower. The watchtower is for
free but it may be equipped with boiling oil for an extra
cost. Watchtower troops cannot be broken and do not
count towards the defenders breakpoint. The rest of the
defending troops are the relief force.

The attacker may only buy sows or mantlets.

==== Set-up

The watchtower is placed in the middle of the table with
the gate directed towards one narrow edge of the table.
The troops defending the watchtower are then placed in
or around the watchtower but no more than 20cm away.

The attacker places his troops at a line at least 60cm away
of the watchtower’s gate. The attacker has the first turn.

In his first round the defender may declare any unit
he can spare as dispatch units. Those units may not be
brigaded but can be sent towards his (the) own table
edge to get help. Any dispatch unit that reaches the
entering edge of the relief force gives a +1 towards the
roll to determine if the relief force arrives...

At the start of the second and subsequent turn on the
defender may roll a D6. On a result of 5+ the relief force
arrives. All characters of the relief force may be placed
at a line at least 70cm away of the watchtower opposite
the attacker. Draw a line across the table at least 90cm
away of the watchtower. The relief force may be placed
behind this line (if the table is not big enough – play as
if the units were placed just outside the table edge). The
relief force may be ordered immediately.

// Heading level increased
==== Special situations

Characters may not join units defending the tower.
Nevertheless they may enter the tower if they are forced
to join a unit within 30cm and count as if they had joined
a unit. However they cannot add their attacks to any
units defending the tower.

Be aware that cannons shooting at troops manning the
tower have no bounce-through effect. Also remember
that troops within the tower do not roll for drive back
and are never confused. If more than one unit mans the
tower, the defender may choose which unit gets hit by
enemy shooting this turn (declare before shooting dice
are rolled). If one unit is fighting against assaulting
troops the other unit is automatically the target. During
the game units defending the tower may not leave it nor
may any defending units enter the tower to restock the
troops in there (even if the gate would be accessible).

==== Victory conditions

The game ends after 8 turns.

At the very moment the Watchtower is conquered the
attacker wins. If the attacker destroys enough units to
break the defending troops the game is a draw.

If the defender breaks the attacking force he wins. If
there is still one stand defending the watchtower at the
end of the game the defender wins.
