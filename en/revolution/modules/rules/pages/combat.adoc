= Combat

Combat represents close quarter fighting between
enemies whether it is continuous hand-to-hand combat,
very short-range missile fire or a combination of both. In
some cases we might imagine units clashing repeatedly
for brief periods which are punctuated by momentary
pauses in which the combatants gather their energy. This
is especially likely when fighting over broken ground
such as woods or amongst ruins or when troops are
assaulting fortifications. In any case, all close quarter
fighting is represented by means of the rules in this
section.

[.bo5a]
In the Combat phase, both players work out all the combat
engagements on the battlefield. See below under <<combat-engagement>>
for a definition.

[.bo5a]
Each combat engagement must be completed before going on to
the next. Combat engagements are fought in rounds and an
engagement can last for one or more rounds depending on the
result.

== Combat engagement

////
// WMR original after "initiative".
Units using their initiative must
always move against the nearest enemy they can see.
Units acting on an order can move against any enemy
within reach and which they can see.
////

Units can move into contact with enemy units during
their Command phase either by means of an order or
by using their initiative.
In both cases, the
move is referred to as a charge. Once units are touching
an enemy unit they are said to be engaged in combat.

Once units have engaged in combat they might typically
be arranged as shown in <<f-combat-engagement>>.

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/combat-engagement.svg[id=f-combat-engagement]

A combat engagement can sometimes involve several
units on one or both sides. All interlinked units are
considered to be fighting in the same engagement. See
<<f-interlinked-engagement>>.

.Where units are interlinked, as shown in the two examples here, they form a single engagement. Such an engagement can involve several units on each side but typically involves two or sometimes three units on one side and only one on the other.

== Attacks

Regardless of whose turn it is, all units which are
engaged in combat can fight in the Combat phase.
[.bo5a]#Both sides make their attacks and either
side can potentially win any combat engagement.#

=== Attack value

All stands have an Attack value which determines how
effective they are in combat. The higher the value, the
better combatants fight. Some troops have two values
separated by a slash. The first is used for close combat
and the second for shooting.

include::partial$attack-values.adoc[]

Work out the attacks of one unit at a time. It is usual
for the player whose turn it is to complete his attacks
before his opponent as this ‘feels right’, especially where
units charge dramatically into combat! Strictly speaking,
it makes no difference who goes first as stands which
fall casualty are allowed to fight back before they are
removed.

[.bo5a]
Where multiple units are engaged on each side, it is most
straightforward to work out all the attacks from one unit at a
time. This makes it easier to remember which stands have fought
and which have not. Where convenient, players may prefer to
resolve attacks from several units at once if they are all fighting
the same enemy unit – this saves rolling different batches of dice.
If there is any possible doubt about who is fighting whom, deal
with each unit one at a time to avoid ambiguity.

image::combat-phase/stands-touching.svg[id=stands-touching]

Every stand touching an enemy stand can fight, even if
it is only touching corner-to-corner or at a side or rear
edge. Hits inflicted are always accumulated against the
target unit as a whole and not against individual stands.

Each stand must direct all of its attacks against a single
enemy unit – it is not permitted to divide a stand’s attack
between two different enemy units. Where a stand can
potentially attack one of two or more enemy units, the
player must declare where all of the unit’s stands are
attacking before rolling dice – this prevents combats
becoming bogged down into stand-by-stand dice rolls.

Stands strike against enemy units as dictated by the
following list of priorities:

. A stand will *always* strike against an enemy
  unit touching its own front edge if possible. If
  a stand is touching more than one enemy unit
  to its front, the player can decide which to
  attack.
. If a stand is not touching the enemy to its front,
  then it must direct its attacks against an
  enemy unit to its *side or rear edge* if possible.
  If a stand is touching more than one enemy
  unit to its side and/or rear edges, the player
  can decide which to attack.
. If a stand is *only* touching an enemy corner-to-corner
  then it can direct its attacks against
  any unit it is touching. Note that where a
  stand’s edge is touching an enemy, it cannot
  direct attacks corner-to-corner: corner-to-corner
  attacks are not allowed where there is
  edge contact.

image::combat-phase/dark-elves.webp[]

=== Attack modifiers

****
The *Attack value* of a stand is modified by tactical factors as shown below. These represent different tactical
situations by means of bonuses or penalties.

include::partial$combat-attack-modifiers.adoc[]
****

==== Charging against enemy in the open

// Extra space e.g.
This bonus applies to all stands where a unit charges
into combat. The bonus only applies in the first combat
round of an engagement. The bonus does not apply if the
enemy are not in the open, e.g. when a stand is fighting
against infantry or artillery in a defended or fortified
position as described later.

==== Monster/chariot charging

This bonus is applied to Monster and Chariot stands
charging in addition to the basic charging bonus. This
means that Monsters and Chariots receive a total bonus
of +2 when charging against enemy stands in the open.

==== Pursuit attack

This bonus applies to stands from pursuing units that
won the previous round of combat and are attacking
enemy units that retreated from the same engagement.
Pursuit bonuses only apply in subsequent rounds of
combat, including the first round of unresolved combats
fought in the previous turn.

==== Pursuit attack per full 3cm

This bonus applies to stands whose units pursue enemies
that have retreated by 3cm or more in the previous
round of the same engagement. The bonus is added
to the standard pursuit bonus. Each full 3cm that the
enemy retreats adds a further +1. So a unit which forces
its enemy to retreat 6cm gets a +1 pursuit bonus plus a
further +1 for each full 3cm, making +3 in total.

==== Fighting terrifying enemy

This penalty applies to all individual stands which
are touching at least one stand of terrifying enemy.
Terrifying enemy include especially scary creatures such
as massive Dragons. The penalty doesn’t apply to units
which are terrifying themselves... you can’t terrify a
terrifying creature! Creatures which terrorise their foes
are indicated in the Army List section.

==== Enemy facing own side or rear

This penalty applies to individual stands which have an
enemy stand’s front edge or front corner touching their
own side edge, rear edge or rear corner. Note that only
enemy front edges and corners impose this penalty.
Opposing stands touching side to side don’t impose a
mutual penalty for example.

==== Confused

This penalty applies to all stands in a confused unit.
Units can become confused as a result of missile fire
or by moving into other friendly units or impassable
terrain. See the section on xref:confusion.adoc[Confusion].

==== The Last Ditch Dice

Attack modifiers can potentially reduce a stand’s Attack
to zero. If this happens, then a unit always rolls one
Attack dice regardless.

image::combat-phase/harpy-hero.webp[]

=== How to calculate damage

To work out the damage inflicted by a unit in combat,
begin by adding up the total Attack value of its fighting
stands. For example, a unit of three stands each with an
Attack value of 3 has a total value of 9.

The total Attack value is the number of dice rolled to
determine how many hits are scored on the enemy. The
minimum dice roll required for a hit is normally four. So,
eight dice rolls of 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 6 and 6 equal four hits on
the enemy.

If enemies are in defended or fortified positions, the roll
needed to hit will be 5+ and 6 respectively. See <<defended-fortified-troops>>.

=== Armour

As already described for shooting, if a unit has armour
then the number of hits scored by the enemy might be
reduced. A unit’s Armour value is expressed as a number:
6+, 5+, 4+ or 3+. This indicates the minimum dice score
needed to nullify a hit. Roll one dice for each hit scored
on the unit. Any dice that rolls equal to or more than
the Armour value of the unit will nullify or ‘save’ one
hit. Hits nullified in this way are ignored – they are not
struck on the target and no further account is taken of
them.

include::partial$divider-axe.adoc[]

=== Casualties

A stand can take a number of hits before it is destroyed,
as described in the xref:shooting.adoc#removing-casualties[Shooting rules]. This
varies depending upon how tough and determined
the unit is. Men have a value of 3, for example, whilst
Dwarfs, an infuriatingly hardy folk, have a value of 4.

Record hits suffered by each unit during the combat
round. Once the round is complete, units that have
suffered hits equal to or greater than their Hits value
must remove one or more stands as casualties. The player
who lost the combat should remove his casualties first
and then the winner. In the case of a draw roll a dice and
the lowest score removes his casualties first. Stands are
removed one at a time from the edge of the formation
so that the formation is not broken at any time, but
otherwise the player can choose which of his stands
to remove. Stands that are not touching an enemy can
be removed as casualties if the player wishes, in which
case it is assumed that casualties occur at the front and
warriors press forward to take their place.

Where a unit takes too few hits to destroy a stand or if it
suffers enough to remove a stand with some remaining,
record any outstanding hits. This is most easily done by
placing a distinctively coloured dice directly behind the
unit to show the number of hits it has taken. If combats
involve several units on each side, it is advisable to use
a notepad and paper to keep a record of casualties.
Alternatively, you can devise suitable markers or simply
remember, whatever you find the most convenient.

At the end of the Combat phase, odd hits are discounted
from units that are no longer engaged. Hits are only
recorded from one turn to the next for units that remain
engaged in an unresoved combat at the end of the Combat
phase. Discounting hits in this way can be thought of as
units recovering their combat efficiency during lulls in
the fighting.

Note that it is important to record hits through the
Combat phase and only discount outstanding hits once
all engagements are finished. This is because it is possible
for units to become involved in a second engagement, for
example as a result of an advance. In such a situation, any
hits accumulated in a previous engagement are carried
forward into the next.

// TODO: Bo5A showing coloured dice

image::combat-phase/wolf-rider.webp[]

== Combat results

After [.bo5a]#all# units have attacked it is time to work out the result. If one side is destroyed then the combat is automatically
won by the survivor, otherwise compare the number of hits inflicted by both sides.

In cases where a unit has been
struck with more hits than it can actually take (for example a unit with a total of nine hits might suffer twelve) then
only count actual hits taken. Excess hits are ignored for purposes of working out combat results.

****
--
[discrete]
== Hits Equal – Draw!

If both sides score the same number of hits, the result is a draw and both sides must *fall back.*

To find out how far a unit falls back, roll three dice. The unit can fall back up to the total score of the
dice. For example, on a roll of 2, 4 and 6 the unit falls back between 0cm and 12cm but must end up
at least 1cm from enemy units or any units engaged in combat. Once the combatants have disengaged
the combat is over. See <<fall-backs>> for more details.

The exception to the fall back rule is that defended or fortified units can stand their ground instead of
falling back. Players may decide to fall back with such units if they prefer. See <<defended-fortified-troops>>
for rules about fighting in defended and fortified positions.

[discrete]
== One Side Scores More Hits – Win!

If one side scores more hits than the other, it wins the combat round.

The loser must retreat 1cm for
each hit taken in excess of hits inflicted. So if one side scores three hits and the other scores one hit,
the second side loses by two and must retreat 2cm. See <<retreats>> for further details about how
to move retreating units.

[.bo5a]#The winner# has a choice of what to do [.bo5a]#once the enemy has retreated#. Victorious units can fall back, stand their
ground or pursue [.bo5a]#a retreating enemy#. If a unit destroys its enemy, it cannot pursue but can advance instead.

*Fall Back.* The victorious unit falls back up to 3D6cm (see <<fall-backs>>). The combat is over.

// TODO link maybe
*Stand its Ground.* The victorious unit remains where it is. The combat is over.

*Pursue.* The victorious unit is moved back into contact and a further round of pursuit combat is fought
in the same way as before. See <<pursuit>>. Any hits already scored are carried over into the next
pursuit round. Hits carried over don’t count towards working out who wins the next round but they
might result in the loss of stands due to cumulative damage. No charge bonus is awarded during a
pursuit but there is a +1 bonus for pursuit itself and further bonuses for pursuing enemy that have
retreated 3cm or more. If a defeated enemy infantry unit has been forced to retreat from a defended
or fortified position then it is no longer defended or fortified.

// "See Enemy Destroyed" is actually "Pursuit and destroyed enemy"
*Advance.* The victorious unit can advance up to 20cm either initiating a new engagement or joining an
existing one. See [.edit]#<<pursuit-and-destroyed-enemy>>#.
--
****

[.h-bo5a]
=== Support

It is possible to affect combat results by using adjacent
infantry stands to support fighting infantry units. This
represents the ability of a unit to threaten the enemy’s
flanks or to provide solidity through depth. Only *infantry*
can support and be supported in this way.

A stand can only support if it is not touching an enemy
and the unit it belongs to is not confused.

[.bo5a]#A supporting# stand
must be aligned either exactly behind or exactly beside
a stand that fought to its front during the combat
round. The supporting stand must also be facing in the
same direction as the supported stand as shown in the
accompanying diagrams. Note that a stand touched by
enemy to its front and sides or rear during the combat
round can be supported, but a stand touched by enemy
only to its sides or rear cannot. A supporting stand can
be from the same unit as the fighting stand it supports or
from a completely different unit. See <<f-supporting-troops>>.

.{empty}
image::combat-phase/supporting-troops.svg[id=f-supporting-troops]

// spelling corrected
For each supporting stand in the combat engagement
*add +1* to the combat result. For example, if a side inflicts
five hits on the enemy and has three supports, its combat
result is 8. Note that supports merely add to the result
and not to the actual number of hits inflicted.
Work out how many supporting stands each side has
once all attacks have been struck but before removing
causalities. Units benefit from support throughout a
combat round even where causalities might remove
supported or supporting stands.

=== Supporting combat

// Bo5a rules differ

Units are automatically included in any combat
engagement where they support. This means they are
affected by the combat result and the usual options
apply. This is covered in the following sections under
<<retreats>> and <<aftermath>>.

Sometimes, a unit finds it is supporting two different
friendly units fighting what would otherwise be two
separate combat engagements. Even in this case, there is
only one combat engagement – not two. All the units are
interlinked via the supporting unit.

[discrete]
[.moved]
=== Supporting charges

[.moved]
→ Moved to xref:movement.adoc#supporting-charges[Movement, Supporting charges].

== Retreats

A unit that loses a combat round must retreat by the
difference in the combat result in centimetres. For
example, if one side scores four hits and the other side
scores one, the losing unit retreats 3cm. Remember to
add any support from both sides before calculating the
result.

If several units are engaged on the losing side, then the
retreat distance must be reduced to take into account
the potentially huge difference in combat results. To
work out the retreat distance, divide the difference in
the combat result by the number of units on the *losing*
side. Remember to include any supporting units and any
units that have been destroyed if they fought that round.
Round any fractions up to the nearest centimetre – the minimum
possible retreat is therefore 1cm. For example if there
are three units on the losing side and the difference is 6,
the losing unit retreat by 2cm.

If two or more units are retreating from the same
engagement then move the units one at a time. The
retreating player can decide in which order to move the
units.

image::combat-phase/retreat-1.svg[id=retreat-1]

A retreating unit moves away from the enemy without
changing formation or the direction it is facing. It will
normally be apparent where to move the unit to. In most
cases, all enemy stands will be aligned solely against the
unit’s front, side or rear and the retreating unit simply
moves in the opposite direction.

image::combat-phase/retreat-2.svg[id=retreat-2]

The direction of the retreat may be less clear if the unit is
fighting enemy from several directions at the same time.
In this case, the unit retreats from the greatest number
of touching enemy stands.
Enemy stands touching corner-to-corner count
as touching the edge that is parallel to the enemy stand’s
front.
[.bo5a]#If the retreating unit has an equal number of enemy stands
in# [.edit]#the most common direction,# the retreating
player can nominate which of the possible directions it
will retreat.

// TODO possible additional diagram

// Spelling fixed
If there are no enemy stands touching the unit due to
removing causalities, retreat from the closest enemy that
was part of the combat engagement.

In a few cases, a unit’s formation may be arranged so
that the direction of the retreat is in doubt. In this case,
identify the retreating *stand* touching the most enemy
stands and work out the unit’s retreat relative to that.
If all stands face the same number of enemy stands, the
player can decide which to use.

If all of a unit is supporting another, e.g. if it is placed in a
second line, then none of its stands are touching an enemy.
In this case, the friendly supported unit(s) determine the
direction of retreat. Work out the direction of retreat for
the fighting units and then move supporting units back in
the same direction. This means fighting and supporting
units will effectively move as one, although it will still be
necessary to move the units one at a time to make sure
that stands have a path to their final position.

image::combat-phase/fan.webp[]

=== Blocked retreats

A retreating stand is destroyed if its retreat move is
blocked. A retreat is considered *blocked* if any part of
the stand’s base is obliged to move through any of the
following:

* Enemy stands
* Impassable terrain
* Stands of other friendly units
  that are engaged in combat (including friendly units that
  have already retreated from the same combat during
  that round)
* Stands from
  unengaged friendly units that do not make way —
  [.bo5a]#friendly units can normally move out of the path of
  retreating units, and this is called xref:confusion.adoc#making-way[making way].#

Stands that are destroyed are removed immediately
without reducing the number of outstanding hits on
their unit.

image::combat-phase/retreat-blocked.svg[id=retreat-blocked]

If unengaged friendly units lie in the way of a unit’s
retreat then these can be moved. The unengaged unit
is said to *make way*. It is up to the player whether the
blocking unit makes way or not. Units which make way
and retreating units forcing others to make way can
become confused as a result. See the Confusion section
for further xref:confusion.adoc#confused-units[rules for confused units] and xref:confusion.adoc#making-way[making way].

A stand’s retreat can potentially bring it into contact
with an enemy stand without intersecting with it. For
example a stand retreats 1cm into an enemy stand exactly
1cm away. In this case, the retreat is blocked if the enemy
units is not part of the same combat engagement. If the
enemy unit is part of the same combat engagement, the
retreat is *not* blocked and the move is covered by the
rules for incidental contacts described later.

Blocked retreats often occur where units are partially
surrounded, for example fighting to the front and rear
at the same time. Blocked retreats also become common
in large engagements as friendly units often get in each
other’s way.

[.edit]#On# rare occasion a unit of three stands may be split
when only the middle stand has blocked retreat. If such
a unit is out of coherency at the end of the turn and no
longer engaged in combat, one of the remaining stands is
automatically destroyed. [.edit]#The# owning player decides which
[.edit]#stand to remove#.

=== Retreating units and incidental contacts

A stand can potentially retreat into contact – but not
intersect – an enemy stand from a unit taking part in the
same combat engagement. This often happens when a
stand is facing enemies to its front and side, because by
retreating from one it must move across the front edge of
another. In such a case the retreat is not blocked and the
stand is not destroyed. What happens next will depend
on what the winner decides to do.

image::combat-phase/retreat-incidental-contact.svg[id=retreat-incidental-contact]

=== Retreating artillery

An artillery unit which is forced to retreat is
automatically destroyed. Its weapons are overrun and the
crew massacred or scattered beyond hope of recovery.

[.h-bo5a]
== Winners

A winning unit can stand, fall back, pursue, or in the
case where all enemy units are destroyed, advance.

Victorious units do not all have to do the same thing and
in some cases it may be impossible for them to do so. The
player deals with the victorious units one at a time in any
order. It makes no difference whether individual units
advance, pursue fall back or stand – the player can deal
with them in any order.

Move victorious units [.bo5a]#once# enemy units have retreated
[.bo5a]#and after# the losing side has completed any necessary moves
to make way and removed any stands whose retreat is
blocked.

[.bo5a]
=== Stand

If a unit stands, it simply stays where it is and does not move.

[.wmr]
image::combat-phase/skeleton-infantry.webp[]

== Pursuit

A unit which wins the first round of an engagement can
pursue a retreating enemy and fight a second round. A
unit that wins a second round of an engagement might
also pursue, in which case the fight continues in the
following turn.

=== Which units can pursue?

A victorious unit can pursue enemies retreating from
the same combat engagement. However, pursuit is not
allowed in the following circumstances:

****
. *Infantry units cannot pursue cavalry or chariots
  retreating from the same engagement.* This
  enables mounted troops to avoid pursuit from
  slower foot troops, and also to cover the retreat
  of friends in some situations.
+
There are a few
exception to this rule. If an infantry unit charges
a cavalry or chariot unit that is in irregular
formation or charges it in the flank or rear, the
infantry unit is permitted to pursue the retreating
cavalry or chariot unit in the round it charged.
For further exceptions see <<infantry-contact-with-cavalry>>.
. *Artillery never pursue* retreating enemies of any
  kind and must stand or fall back instead.
. *Fortified units never pursue.* If they win a combat
  they must fall back or stand their ground.
. *Troops never pursue enemy who have retreated
  into or through terrain they cannot enter.* For
  example, cavalry cannot pursue infantry who
  retreat into a wood. There must be at least 1cm of
  edge outside the wood.
. [.bo5a]#*Non-flying units never pursue retreating flying units.*
  Only flying units can pursue retreating flying units. If a non-flying
  unit wins a combat against a flying unit then it must either
  stand or fallback. If standing would leave the non-flying unit
  touching enemy flyers then it must fall back.#
+
Exceptions:
a flying unit can be pursued by a non-flying unit
when charged in the flank or rear or when in
irregular formation in the round it charged. For
further exceptions see <<infantry-contact-with-cavalry>>.
****

=== Moving pursuers

// TODO: The whole Pursuit section is significantly edited.

[.bo5a]
Pursuing units are moved back into contact with enemy units that
retreated away from them.
Pursuing stands can move up to a normal full pace move
to close the gap between themselves and either the
enemy or the stand they are going to support.

Move pursuers one unit at a time starting with units that
can see the retreating enemy. Where several units can
pursue the same enemy, the victorious player can move
them in whatever order he wants. The sequence can be
important as one unit’s move can easily obstruct that
of another either blocking line of sight or affecting the
positioning of subsequent units.

If pursuing unit cannot see a retreating enemy unit (for
example, because other pursuers have obscured their
view), then pursuers cannot move into edge contact.
Note that units unable to see an enemy may still be able
to move into support as described under <<supporting-pursuits>>.

Occasionally, it will be impossible for a unit to pursue
into edge contact even though it can see an enemy. For
example, terrain or other units may block the unit’s path.
In such a case, and only in such a case, a unit that can
see an enemy is allowed to make a supporting pursuit
instead (See <<supporting-pursuits>>).

All pursuing stands must be able to trace a clear path
towards the enemy. Towards means just that – a pursuer’s
path cannot take it away from the enemy and then back
again by a circuitous route.

image::combat-phase/punk-orc.webp[]

=== Basic pursuit

Choose a unit to make a pursuit move. Every stand that
can move straight forward so that its front edge contacts
an enemy stand must do so. This includes stands of enemy
units that were in supporting position before causalities
were removed. In many cases, the entire unit will move
in this way. Once all of the unit’s stands that can move
straight towards the enemy have done so, the unit’s
remaining stands can be placed as the player wishes and
can be placed into contact with the enemy or not, either
as the player wants or as circumstance dictates.

The obligation to move stands straight ahead is waived
where doing so would cause a unit to split its formation.
This can happen where multiple enemy units retreat
in different directions for example. In such cases, the
player can choose which stands will pursue so as to avoid
splitting the formation.

Note that the pursuing rules allow some stands to be
arranged around the sides or rear edges of the enemy
where there is room. This enables a victorious unit to
lap around the enemy and maximise his attacks in the
following round. Conversely, the rules also allow stands
to be positioned to fight from a corner, to support, or to
extend a unit’s position to meet a charge in a subsequent
turn.

=== Indirect pursuit

Occasionally, you will find that no stands can pursue by
moving straight ahead even though the unit can see a
retreating enemy. In this case, a unit can pursue as long
as at least one stand has a clear path towards the
enemy.

Take any one pursuing stand that can see the retreating
enemy. Move the stand into contact with the closest
visible enemy stand exactly as you would during a
charge. Having placed the first stand, remaining stands
are positioned as the player wishes, as already described
for basic pursuits.

image::combat-phase/pursuit-indirect.svg[id=pursuit-indirect]

=== Supporting pursuits

A unit that cannot see a retreating enemy cannot pursue
into edge contact. Such a unit might still be able to pursue
in order to support a fighting friend. As only infantry can
support and be supported, it follows that only infantry
are able to pursue in this way. This is called *supporting
pursuit*.

A unit can also make a supporting pursuit if it can see
a retreating enemy but it is impossible to pursue into
edge contact for whatever reason. Units able to pursue
into contact cannot choose to make a supporting pursuit
instead.

// Spelling of victorious fixed
image::combat-phase/pursuit-supporting.svg[id=pursuit-supporting]

To make a supporting pursuit at least one stand must
be moved straight ahead so that it is directly behind or
directly beside a fighting infantry stand from a different
unit. Note that this might coincidentally bring the stand
into corner-to-corner contact with enemy, in which
case the stand can fight in the following round. If it is
impossible for at least one stand to move as described
then the unit cannot pursue.

When one stand has been moved into position as
described, the unit’s remaining stands can be moved into
formation. These stands can be positioned as the player
wishes so long as they are not placed into edge contact
with any enemy stands.

Note that although supporting pursuer cannot be placed
into edge contact with enemies, they can be positioned
into corner-to-corner contact. Often this is the inevitable
result of stands moving into what would otherwise be
supporting position.

include::partial$divider-axe.adoc[]

=== Incidental contact

When moving a pursuer into contact with retreating
enemies, it is possible for stands to come into contact
with enemy units that were not previously engaged in
the same combat. This is called *incidental contact*.

image::combat-phase/incidental-contact.svg[id=f-incidental-contact]

Incidental contact is sometimes unavoidable. It will
depend on the order in which pursuers are moved and,
in some cases, how a player chooses to position pursuing
stands. However, units making a supporting pursuit
are not permitted to contact any enemy stands edge-to-
edge, not even as incidental contacts. See Supporting
Pursuits. Any opposing units touching once pursuits are
complete are automatically drawn into the engagement.
It is important to remember that pursuit bonuses apply
only against enemy units that fought in and retreated
from the same combat engagement as the pursuer in
the previous round. No pursuit or charge bonuses apply
against newly engaged enemy units.

In case of incidental contact with an enemy unit that is
part of another engagement the situation depends on
whether that engagement was already fought or not. If
the engagement was already fought and was therefore
left unresolved, the retreating and pursuing units
become part of that unresolved combat and no other
rounds are fought. If the engagement hasn’t been fought
yet, it becomes part of the actual combat. However,
the newly engaged units can fight at most one round
of combat alongside the pursuing and retreating units.
If the incidental contact occurs as a result of a second
round of combat, the newly engaged units do not get to
fight in this combat phase.

=== Infantry contact with cavalry

It can sometimes happen that infantry maintain contact
with retreating cavalry or chariots. This can occur where
infantry pursue enemy infantry and end up in corner-to-
corner or side-to-side edge contact with enemy cavalry or
chariots that have retreated alongside them. Contact can
also be maintained where a unit is obliged to retreat at
a right angle along an enemy infantry formation. In all
these cases, retreating units that remain in contact with
their enemy also remain engaged for the following round
regardless of rules that normally forbid pursuit. Where
attacks are struck against retreating cavalry/chariots the
usual pursuit bonuses apply. Same principle applies on
non-flying units pursuing flyers.

image::combat-phase/pursuit-maintain-contact.svg[id=pursuit-maintain-contact]

=== Impossible to pursue

It can happen that it is impossible for a unit to pursue
– for example because no stands can be moved into
front edge contact or into supporting positions. Such
a situation sometimes occurs where other units have
already pursued a retreating enemy and blocked line of
sight, for example. A unit that cannot pursue a retreating
enemy must either stand or fall back. The unit is not
allowed to advance instead.

image::combat-phase/goblin-wolves.webp[]

=== Pursuit and destroyed enemy

A unit is destroyed once all of its stands have been
removed as casualties. At the end of a combat round, it is
possible that all the units engaged on one side will have
been entirely destroyed. In such a case the victorious
units can advance. Pursuit is not possible because there
are no retreating enemies to pursue against. See Advance.

=== Pursuit and Combat Dropouts

It can happen that several units retreat on one side but
pursuers move in such a way that one or more retreating
units are no longer engaged in the combat. A unit
remains engaged whilst it is either touching an enemy,
or supporting stands that are touching an enemy, but it
is quite possible for retreating units to find they are no
longer in combat at all. Such units simply drop out of the
combat engagement like any other units that have not
been pursued. It is possible for such units to be contacted
by pursuers during subsequent rounds of combat, in
which case they are treated as new incidental contacts.
See Incidental Contacts.

=== Pursuit in Terrain

Visibility within woods (and other features described in
Advanced Terrain Rules on p80) is restricted to 2cm for
most purposes, but in the case of combatants we make
an exception. If units are fighting inside a wood (or
other features with restricted visibility) then potential
pursuers are assumed to be able to see units that have
retreated from the same combat. This represents the fact
that combatants would actually move together without
one side necessarily losing sight of the other as they
retreat.

== Advance

// Bold altered
If all the enemy units in a combat engagement are
destroyed, a victorious unit can do one of three things: it
can *stand its ground*, *fall back*, or *advance*.

// Bo5A difference: that a unit is touching, rather than the whole combat.

Note that in a combat engagement with multiple units
on both sides, all enemy units have to be destroyed for
an advance to be able to happen. When friendly units
fighting together in single combat get separated by the
removal of stands, they still count as being in the same
combat engagement until the end of the current Combat
Phase.

A unit is only allowed to advance once in a Combat phase
even if its enemies are destroyed a second time.

An advance is essentially a new charge move of 20cm.
An advancing unit can charge the closest enemy unit
that it can see and which it can reach. The unit cannot
charge any other enemy unit and if there is no visible
enemy within reach the unit cannot advance. This is
comparable to a charge move made on initiative in the
Command phase.

The advancing unit’s move is worked out in the same
way as a charge except that no stand may move further
than 20cm regardless of its usual move rate or formation.
This also applies [.edit]#to any supporting units#.

Units can’t advance through terrain they can’t enter,
if they are in fortified positions, if there is no path to
enable them to do so, if the unit is artillery, or if they
have already advanced in that Combat phase. Otherwise,
units are allowed to advance against any kind of enemy,
even if they are a troop type that would not normally be
allowed to pursue, such as infantry fighting cavalry or
chariots.

image::combat-phase/dwarf-slayers.webp[]

Although the move is essentially the same as a charge, no
charge bonus of any kind applies to advances: this takes
into account a measure of exhaustion resulting from
prolonged combat.
// (Bo5A difference.)

An advance might initiate a new combat engagement, it
might bring the advancing unit into an existing unfought
engagement, or it might bring the advancing unit into
an engagement that has been fought but which remains
unresolved.

If advancing into an engagement that has already been
fought that turn (an unresolved combat), the advancing
unit will fight in the Combat phase of the *following* turn.

If advancing into an existing unfought engagement or a
new combat engagement, the advancing unit fights as
part of the engagement *that turn*. This means the unit
fights in two separate engagements during the same
Combat phase and could, potentially, fight up to four
rounds of combat during the turn.

An enemy unit that has been advanced upon can shoot
at the advancing unit in exactly the same way as a unit
shooting at chargers in the Command phase.

// Spelling of engagement
Any hits already accumulated against the advancing unit
from its first engagement are carried over into the new
combat engagement.

.Optional rule
****
If the enemy is destroyed in the first round of
combat, the advancing unit gets a charge bonus as
per normal charge.

== Fall backs

In a drawn combat both sides must fall back unless one
side is in a defended or fortified position in which case
it can stand instead. A victorious unit can choose to fall
back if the player wishes. The opportunity to fall back
gives players a chance to pull units out of combat and
move them to better tactical positions.

If both players have units falling back from a drawn
combat each side takes it in turn to select and move one
unit – roll a dice to determine which side goes first. 1, 2,
3 one side, 4, 5, 6 the other.

A fall back is basically a free move that represents the
unit rallying back on its standards and officers. This
move is made in the same way as a move by order except
that the maximum distance is determined randomly and
the direction must be ‘back’ as defined below.

The maximum distance a unit falls back is established by
rolling three dice and adding the scores together. So, on a
roll of 6, 4, and 3, a unit can fall back up to 13cm. There is
no minimum distance – a unit that has elected to fall back
does not to have to move at all so long as it is at least 1cm
from enemy units and from any units engaged in combat
as described below.

Where several friendly units fall back out of the same
combat at the same time, one roll is made for them all.
The same maximum distance applies to all, but units do
not all have to move the same actual distance.

Stands that are falling back are allowed to momentarily
contact the enemy stands belonging to units touching
their own unit during the combat round. This allows
stands to ‘slide’ out of position as they fall back – often
this will be unavoidable. Stands cannot contact enemy
stands from units they were not touching during the
combat round.

Stands that fall back must end their move at least
1cm from any enemy units and from any units that
are engaged in combat whether friends or foes. If it is
impossible to move all the stands so they are at least
1cm from enemy or engaged friends, then the unit is
automatically confused. See xref:confusion.adoc[Confusion].

Occasionally, opposing stands are still touching at the
end of the Combat round once both sides have fallen
back. If this happens, units remain engaged in combat
and will fight in the following round. Units that fall back
but fail to break contact are automatically confused by
dint of being within 1cm of enemy.

image::combat-phase/village.webp[]

=== Moving back

When a unit falls back, the player selects any one stand
from the unit and moves it back. In this case, ‘back’ is
defined as behind the line drawn across the line of contact
with the enemy units. See <<fall-back-line>> and <<fall-back-corner>>. Other
stands can then be moved into formation as convenient
so long as they do not exceed their permitted move.
They can be positioned forward of the line established
for the first stand if desired. Note that the unit does not
necessarily fall back towards its own base edge or its
own friends – the ‘back’ position is worked out relative
to the first stand moved.

== Unresolved combats

// Spelling pursue fixed
If after two rounds of combat both sides are still engaged
then the combat is *unresolved*. All units remain in
position and fighting resumes in the Combat phase of
the following turn. This is quite common and happens
where a second round results in one unit retreating and
the victors elect to pursue.

It is important to remember where pursuit bonuses
apply from the final round of the previous Combat
phase. These bonuses will apply in the first round of
the following Combat phase to those pursuers who
are fighting retreating enemy. It is a good idea to make
a separate note or use some kind of marker to remind
players which bonuses apply to which combatants.

// Bo5A has rules on Reforming, not included in WMR.

== Remove odd hits

Once all combat engagements have been fought, remove
any odd hits remaining on units that are no longer
engaged in combat. Note that units that are part of an
unresolved combat do not remove odd hits but carry
them over into the following turn. This includes any
units that are only supporting.

image::combat-phase/cold-combat.webp[]

== Defended & fortified troops

Only infantry, flying troops, and giants can move into
base contact with fortified enemy stands at any time – for
example by charging, during a pursuit, or as a result of an
advance. Where other stands would accidentally contact
a fortified enemy – for example by charging an adjacent
unfortified unit these stands must be repositioned so
that they no longer contact a fortified enemy stand. Note
that this overrides the normal obligation to maximise
edge contact against enemy units where this applies.
Any position that brings troop stands, other than those
indicated, into contact with fortified enemy is simply
ineligible. If circumstance dictates that such a stand is
unable to be positioned out of contact with fortified
enemy then it is destroyed and does not fight.

Infantry and artillery units, however, can take advantages
of natural vegetation, the lie of the land, fieldworks or
permanent fortifications in order to make their position
much more secure. This allows infantry and artillery
stands to be either defended or fortified. In both cases
the score required to hit will increase as shown on the
chart below.

[cols="2,^1",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Target |D6 result required

|Fortified infantry/artillery    |6+
|Defended infantry/artillery     |5+
|All other targets/circumstances |4+
|===

=== Defended

A stand is defended if it is placed wholly or partially;
behind a low obstacle, such as a hedge or wall; at the
edge of or within a wood; or amongst ruins or buildings.
A stand is also defended if it is positioned on the crest
or upper slope of a hill or rise so that it occupies higher
ground than the charger at any point of the charge
move. These are all judged to be situations that confer an
advantage to infantry or to small units of artillery (even
against flying units). Such units can position themselves
closely to the lie of the land, taking advantage of minor
folds in the ground, local vegetation, or barriers such
as hedges or ditches. This advantage is partly due to a
unit’s ability to entrench itself, for individual warriors
to find cover, or for whole units to conceal themselves
–for example by kneeling amongst dense undergrowth.
Similarly, it confers an advantage to a unit that has taken
up a position that is hard or exhausting for an enemy to
approach.

Note that a unit can gain the defended status only when
charged from the direction it can get advantage of the
terrain feature, e.g. from the other side of the fence or
up the hill slope.

=== Fortified

A stand is fortified if it is placed on the ramparts of a
substantial fortification such as a castle wall, tower, fort
or a large permanent earthwork.

These situations do not regularly occur in field battles
but are included here for the sake of completeness. A
well prepared field fortification might be considered to
be a fortified rather than defended position – but only if
it is constructed and positioned in such a way that troops
must resort to climbing or scrambling up a steep slope in
order to attack.

=== Defended & fortified enemy

Only infantry, flying troops, and giants can move into
base contact with fortified enemy stands at any time –
for example by charging, during a pursuit, or as a result
of an advance. Cavalry, chariots, artillery and non-
flying monsters and machines cannot do so. In the case
of castle walls, towers and similarly tall fortifications,
specialist equipment may be needed to mount an assault
as described in the chapter xref:siege-and-fortresses.adoc[Siege & Fortresses].

Defended or fortified stands are harder to hit as
described above. Hence a score of 5+ or 6 respectively is
needed to inflict hits. Also, charge bonuses don’t count
against them because they are not ‘in the open’. The most
common occurrences of this during a game are situations
where infantry are on the upper slopes of hills or at the
edge of a wood.

Cavalry, chariots, machine and monster stands never
count as being defended or fortified, even when they
have moved onto hills, behind hedges, low walls and
so forth. In these situations, cavalry and chariots are
assumed to have to move in order to fight, surrendering
any advantage of shelter in favour of greater mobility.

Monsters and machines are simply too big or too
dimwitted to take advantage of cover.

Troops that charge or advance are always assumed to be
in the open, such as infantry stands charging in a wood.
Troops that pursue a retreating enemy are also assumed
to be in the open. In both cases, troops cannot take
advantage of cover whilst pressing their attack. Troops
that retreat in one combat round always count as being
in the open during following rounds of pursuit combat.
In most cases, this is obvious because enemy will have
been pushed over a low wall or rampart. In other cases,
a unit may be still inside a wood or still up-slope of an
enemy. However, a unit always loses the advantage of its
position once it has retreated.
