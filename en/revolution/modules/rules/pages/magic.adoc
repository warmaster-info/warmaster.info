= Magic

Magic is a potent ally but a dangerous adversary. All
armies make use of some sort of sorcery so it is
important to have a grasp of the arcane abilities that lie
at your command.

== Spells

Only Wizards can cast spells. The term ‘Wizard’ includes
various types of sorcerer such as Orc Shamans, Elven
Mages, Undead Liche Priests as well as human Wizards.
Every army’s magic is different and some are better
than others as we shall see. Individual spells are listed in
Army List section of this book.

== Magic items

Magic items are devices such as banners, swords or
armour that confer special attacks, protection, etc. Each
magic item has its own rules and points value. When
you choose an army you can include magic items in it.
Any unit of infantry, cavalry or chariots can be given
one magic item. Each character can also be given one
magic item. If you decide to give a magic item to a unit
or character then you must pay the extra points. This
means that you will have less points for other troops.

Magic items cannot be given to monsters or war
machines. Some items can only be given to characters or
to a Wizard as described later.

== Casting spells

In his Shooting phase, each Wizard can cast one spell
from the spell lists for his army. He can cast a spell even
if he has joined a unit that is engaged in combat. The spell
has a range just like a shooting weapon and the target
unit must lie within this distance. Unlike shooting from
missile weapons, the Wizard does not have to target the
closest enemy unit but can choose whichever enemy unit
he wants. The Wizard is assumed to be able to see all
round though his vision will be blocked by unit stands
and terrain as usual.

The Wizard nominates the target and must roll the
required dice score to make the spell work; usually 4+,
5+ or 6 depending on how difficult the spell is to cast.

If you are successful, the spell works as described. If
not then the spell has failed and there is no effect. The
score required is sometimes modified but, regardless of
any modifier, a dice roll of 1 always fails and a roll of 6
always succeeds.

Wizards can cast spells against any eligible targets
within range, but a unit can only ever be affected by the
same spell once in any turn. A unit has been affected if
a spell has worked by rolling the appropriate dice score,
has not been dispelled or antimagicked, and its effect has
been resolved on the unit as per the spell description.
Note that a spell might take full effect but still cause no
damage – a Ball of Flame inflicts 3 shooting attacks for
example but all 3 might fail to score hits or hits might be
nullified by armour.

There are some situations where the target of a spell is
not literally a unit – for example the Ball of Flame and
Gotcha! spells inflict shooting attacks upon all units
that lie within their path. In these cases, all units are
affected once the appropriate dice roll has been scored to
make the spell work and assuming it is not dispelled or
antimagicked. Note that this means a unit can potentially
be struck by two different Ball of Flame spells coming
from different directions – but only the first will affect it.

Where there might be room for doubt, the spell
descriptions specifically remind players that spells
cannot affect the same unit twice. This is just to clarify
the rule where it was felt worthwhile to do so. The rule
applies to all spells not just those that contain a separate
note.

// Spelling e.g.
Logically minded players might quibble that a spell could
be cast upon a unit any number of times e.g., blasting
it to pieces with fireballs from dozens of wizards.
The restriction exists so that magic is rarely enough
to cause casualties on its own. Magic is intended to
augment conventional tactics and weaponry not from
a battle-winning tactic in itself. For this reason wizards
are allowed to target their spells upon specific foes,
selectively augmenting conventional weaponry, but are
prohibited from picking out single units for annihilation
with the same destructive spell cast over & over again.

== Magic items

Our armies rely on brute strength, courage and
meticulous training to overthrow their opponents... and
if that doesn’t work there’s always sorcery. It’s not just
Wizards that get to use magic. Units can have magic
items and other characters can carry them too.

Magic is part and parcel of the fantastic world our
armies are fighting over. To keep things fair, each item
is allotted a points value, just like the troops themselves,
and some items can only be used by certain races or
types of warrior. There are three broad types of magic
item: Magic Standards (most of which protect the unit
carrying them in some way), Magic Weapons (which
are carried by a unit’s leader and which usually increase
the unit’s fighting power) and Devices of Power (which
increase the leadership abilities of Generals, Wizards
and Heroes).

=== Magic standards

// Spelling available
_A unit of infantry, cavalry or chariots can be given a
single Magic Standard. Characters and other types of
units cannot be given Magic Standards. An army can
never include more than a single example of each type
of standard. Magic Standards serve to make a unit more
difficult to destroy by increasing its Armour value or
number of Hits. The effect doesn‘t apply on any attached
stands (such as Empire Skirmishers) or characters.
Some banners have various ranks available only to units
with specific values of Armour or Hits._

As a general rule, a unit or character can only have one
magic item. A unit of infantry can have a Magic Banner
or a Magic Weapon, for example, but not both. Similarly,
a Wizard can have a Magic Weapon or a Device of
Power but not one of each. Furthermore, a specific item
may only appear in an army once. You cannot have two
Banners of Fortitude or three Swords of Cleaving, for
example.

==== The Battle Banner

[.cost]#Cost# [.points]#30 pts#

A unit with this banner increases the Attacks value of each of
its stands by +1 during its first Combat engagement of fighting.
The effect only lasts for the first combat engagement of the
battle, including rounds of pursuit combat during the same
engagement and any further engagements which result from
an advance.

==== The Banner of Shielding

[.cost]#Cost – superior (units with Armour 4+ only)# [.points]#50 pts#

[.cost]#Cost – major (units with Armour 5+ only)# [.points]#30 pts#

[.cost]#Cost – minor (units with Armour 6+ or 0 only)# [.points]#15 pts#

A unit with this banner has its Armour value increased in
effectiveness by \+1. If the unit’s Armour value is 5+ then this
banner increases it to 4+ and so on. A unit’s Armour value
cannot be better than 3+. If a unit already has an Armour value
of 3+ then this banner has no effect. This bonus lasts until the
unit loses a stand. After the unit has lost a stand, the banner
has no further effect.

==== The Banner of Fortitude

[.cost]#Cost – major (units with 4 Hits only)# [.points]#50 pts#

[.cost]#Cost – minor (units with 3 or 2 Hits only)# [.points]#30 pts#

A unit with this banner increases the Hits value of each of its
stands by +1 during its first Combat engagement of fighting.
The effect only lasts for the first combat engagement of the
battle, including rounds of pursuit combat during the same
engagement and any further engagements which result
from an advance. Discard odd hits at the end of the Combat
engagement before discounting the effect of the Banner of
Fortitude.

==== The Banner of Steadfastness

[.cost]#Cost – superior (units with 4+ Armour only)# [.points]#20 pts#

[.cost]#Cost – major (units with 5+ Armour only)# [.points]#15 pts#

[.cost]#Cost – minor (units with 6+ Armour only)# [.points]#10 pts#

One shooting hit inflicted on the unit after saves have been
taken in each turn is ignored because the missiles are cast aside
by the Banner of Steadfastness. This includes hits from magic
spells inflicted in the Shooting phase. This effect lasts until the
unit loses a stand. After the unit has lost a stand the banner has
no further effect.

==== The Banner of Fortune

[.cost]#Cost# [.points]#15 pts#

The player can choose to immediately re-roll all the unit’s
Attack dice once in either the Shooting phase or Combat
phase. This includes any bonus attacks from magic items or
characters. The player declares that he is unsatisfied with the
scores he has rolled, takes all the dice and immediately rolls
them all once again. Note that the player must roll all the dice
again, including any that have scored hits, so it is possible to be
very unfortunate and roll an even worse score! The Banner of
Fortune works only once during the game.

=== Magic weapons

_Magic weapons can be carried by an infantry, cavalry or chariot
unit or by a character. Only a single example of each type of
magic weapon can be included in an army._

==== Sword of Destruction

[.cost]#Cost# [.points]#10 pts#

If a unit has this weapon then one enemy unit that it is touching is
affected and must re-roll one successful Armour roll in each round
of combat. For example, if three hits are scored and one is saved by
armour then the successful roll must be taken again. Only one enemy
unit can be affected by this.

==== Sword of Fate

[.cost]#Cost# [.points]#5 pts#

In the first round of the unit’s first combat, a unit with this sword adds
a +1 bonus to the Attack value of one stand in a similar way as the
Attack bonus of a character. The Sword of Fate only works once in
the entire game. Note that this gives +1 Attack in total and not +1 to
each stand!

==== Sword of Cleaving

[.cost]#Cost# [.points]#10 pts#

A unit with this sword can re-roll one unsuccessful Attack dice each
round of combat.

==== Sword of Might

[.cost]#Cost# [.points]#10 pts#

A unit with this sword adds a +1 bonus to the Attack value of one
stand, similar to the Attack bonus of a character. Note that this gives
+1 Attack in total, not +1 to each stand!

=== Devices of power

_Devices of power can be carried by characters. Only a single
example of each device can be included in an army._

==== Crown of Command

[.cost]#General only# [.points]#70 pts#

If the General has this potent magic item he can choose to issue his first
order of each turn against an unmodified Command value of 10. No
command penalties apply when the Crown of Command is used. This
only applies to the General’s first order each turn, subsequent orders
must be given normally. Should the General fail to issue his first order,
by rolling an 11 or 12, then the Crown of Command ceases to work.

==== Helm of Dominion

[.cost]#General only# [.points]#40 pts#

Only a General is allowed to wear the Helm of Dominion (only his
head is big enough!). The General’s Command value is increased by +1
up to a maximum value of 10. The Helm of Dominion works for one
turn only during the entire battle, the player must specify at the start
of the turn if he wishes to employ its powers.

==== Orb of Majesty

[.cost]#General only# [.points]#30 pts#

If the General has this magic item he may disregard a single failed
Command test and roll it again as if he had a Command value of 8. The
usual adjustments are made for Command penalties but note that the
previously failed roll is disregarded so it doesn’t count as a penalty. If
the re-roll is successful the order is issued and the General can continue
issuing orders in the usual way with his normal Command value.

The Orb of Majesty will only work once in the entire game and only
affects an order that has been issued by the General.

==== Ring of Magic

[.cost]#Wizard only# [.points]#30 pts#

A Wizard with this ring is able to cast a spell without making the usual
dice roll to do so. This item will only work once in the entire game.

==== Staff of Spellbinding

[.cost]#Wizard or Dwarf Runesmith only# [.points]#30 pts#

If an enemy Wizard fails to cast a spell, he can be spellbound on the D6
roll of a 4+. A spellbound Wizard suffers a -1 dice penalty each time he
tries to cast a spell. The Staff of Spellbinding ceases to work once it has
been used successfully. It follows that only one enemy Wizard can be
spellbound as a result.

==== Sceptre of Sovreignty

[.cost]#General only# [.points]#30 pts#

If the General carries the Sceptre of Sovereignty, he may ignore one
blundered ‘double 6’ roll for an order made by either himself or any
of the army’s other characters. If the blunder is made by a subordinate
character you can roll to see what the blunder is before deciding
whether to use the Sceptre of Sovereignty or not. If ignored, the
Command test is passed and the character may continue issuing orders
as normal. The steely will of the Sceptre of Sovereignty reaches out and
stays the incompetent wretch before the deed is done.

==== Scroll of Dispelling

[.cost]#Wizard or Dwarf runesmith only# [.points]#20 pts#

If a Wizard or a Dwarf Runesmith has the Scroll of Dispelling he can
automatically cause an enemy’s spell to fail. The Scroll can only be used
once to nullify the effect of a spell an enemy Wizard has successfully
cast. In the case of a Runesmith, the Scroll can be used after a normal
Dwarf anti-magic roll has failed.

==== Wand of Power

[.cost]#Wizard only# [.points]#10 pts#

A Wizard with the Wand of Power can add +1 to the chance of a spell
working once during the game. The player must decide that he is using
the Wand of Power before rolling the dice. As always a spell fails on
the roll of a 1 even when using the Wand of Power.

==== Rod of Repetition

[.cost]#Wizard only# [.points]#10 pts#

If a Wizard casts a spell and rolls sufficiently well for it to work then he
can cast another spell. He can only do this once during the entire game.
Note that it does not matter if the previous spell is dispelled or anti-
magicked by a Runesmith so long as the required dice score is rolled.
Once any effects of the previous spell have been resolved, the Wizard
can decide to use the Rod of Repetition to cast another spell – this can
be the same spell again or a different one. Note that the same spell can
be cast upon the same unit if the previous spell has been dispelled/
anti-magicked. This next spell is cast exactly like any other – roll a dice
to determine if it works in the usual way.

Note that some spells, such as the Teleport spell, already allow for the
possibility of casting a further spell on a random dice roll. In these
cases the Rod of Repetition can be used instead of the random dice roll
to try and cast the second spell if you prefer, or the Rod of Repetition
could be used after the second spell has been cast assuming it is cast
successfully. By using the Rod of Repetition with spells of this kind
it is possible to cast the spell again, however, you do lose the bonus
spell option, effectively restricting casting to a maximum of 3 spells
per turn. For example: Teleport, 2nd spell, RoR, 3rd spell – or – 1st spell,
RoR, Teleport, 3rd spell – supposing the 1st, 2nd or 3rd spell may be a
Teleport too.
