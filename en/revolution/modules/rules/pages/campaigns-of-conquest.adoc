= Campaigns of Conquest

== Introduction

These campaign rules are based on the rules written by
Rick Priestly and Jervis Johnson for Mighty Empires
campaign supplement designed for 8th edition of
Warhammer. The supplement included a map consisting
of hexagonal map tiles and variety of markers. Here
the rules are adjusted for the Warmaster environment.
Though the rules were designed primarily for the original
map supplement, it can be used for any map system as
long as it is segmented into a sufficient number of fields.

In our experience complex campaign systems tend
to stumble and die out rather quickly. Philosophy of
this system is to keep it as simple as possible yet still
motivating to fight and contest over new territory.
In the current digital age it is possible, and even more
convenient to control the whole campaign on-line rather
than have to arrange for all the players to meet together
for the campaign to progress.

== Warmaster campaign

You will need at least two – and preferably three or more
– rival players compete for territory until one player
conquers the others or establishes an empire of such size
and power he is declared the victor. During each round
of the campaign the participating players play a game of
Warmaster and, depending upon their degree of success,
they can expand their territories into their neighbours.

// Spelling territory
The map is used to show the territory that each player
controls. Each player begins with one tile marked with a
banner in his chosen colour. When games of Warmaster
are fought, players are awarded ‘Empire Points’ that are
used to take over adjoining tiles as explained below. As a
player’s empire expands he places banners on the tiles to
mark his territory.

The winner is the first player to carve out an empire of
ten tiles – this is a simple way of working out who has
won and you can set this target higher or lower as you
wish.

== Starting a campaign

In case you don’t have the original supplement with
plastic tiles and markers, you will need to create a map
divided into sufficient number of fields (tiles). The map
needs to have at least seven tiles for every player taking
part. There are various tile types. The rules distinguish
common wood/countryside tiles, river tiles, mountain
tiles and shore tiles. You will also need banner markers
in a distinctive colour for each player. Further markers
used in the rules are mines, ports, castles, cities and
objectives.

// Spelling available (twice)
Once you have a map, each player must now choose a
capital city from amongst the cities on the campaign
map. Choose an order in which players pick a capital
city available on the map. A capital cannot be chosen
next to another capital – there must be a gap at least 1
tile between them. If there are no available capital cities
left on the map then the player may add a new city to
the map to claim as their capital. Once each player has
selected his capital you are ready to play. Note that no
others tiles are claimed at this stage – players will get to
do that as the game progresses.

It is good idea to put few objectives on a map to motivate
players to fight over them (see Objectives). They should
be placed and spread in neutral area so all players have
similar chance to reach them.

== The largest empire

During the campaign players will often need to do things
in a certain order depending on the size of their empires.
This is determined by counting the number of tiles each
player controls. Tiles that contain a city count as two
tiles when working out the size of a player’s empire. At
the start of the turn, count how many tiles each player
controls. The player with the most tiles has the largest
empire, the player with the second most tiles has the
second largest empire, and so on. If players are tied for
the number of tiles, use the number of cities as tiebreak,
then the number of castles, and finally a dice roll if they
are otherwise identical. This order is for the whole turn,
even if circumstances change.

== Sequence of play

// Extra paragraph removed
The campaign is fought over a number of rounds.
Ideally – all players must be present for each round or
alternatively (and most likely) it can be organised online
through internet forums. There are also many online
dice roll rooms on the internet these days, which are
ideal to solve all the required
rolls online. A typical group of players will usually
work through one round every week, but it all depends
on how often you can get together. It is even possible
to play a whole campaign over a single weekend. At
the end of each round, players must organise and play
any Warmaster games that are required the before next
round can proceed. In each round all players work their
way through the following sequence of play. All the
players carry out the event phase, then all carry out the
revenue phase, and so on.

. Events
. Revenue
. Challenge
. Battle
. Conquest & Build

=== Events phase

Each player picks one event from the event chart,
starting with the player with the smallest Empire. You
cannot pick an event that has already been chosen by
another player, unless all the events have already been
chosen at least once.

// Spelling receive (4)
. *Fool’s Gold* – Pick a Player. That player cannot
collect any revenue during this round.

. *Building Boom* – You may place a castle, mine or
port in any tile that you control, or replace a castle
you control with a city.

. *Disaster* – Pick one player. They must roll a D6 for
each castle, city, port or Mine. On a roll of 1 the
place is destroyed.

. *All or Nothing* – You receive an extra 2 empire
points this round as long as you don’t lose or draw
any battles. If you lose or draw then you receive no
empire points at all this round.

. *Scouts* – In any battles you fight in this round, your
opponent must deploy their whole army before you
deploy your army, and you decide who gets the first
turn.

. *Diplomacy* – Pick one player. They may not issue a
challenge against you this round.

. *Land Grab* – The first tile you claim this turn only
cost 1 empire point rather than the normal 2.

. *Elite Army* – In any battles you fight this round, you
may take one unit over Min/Max value.

=== Revenue phase

Each player collects revenue from any mines they
control. The gold is added to the player’s treasury each
round and can be spent or saved up and spent in future
rounds. Players must keep track of how much gold they
have.

Mines generate 2D6 × 10 gold pieces to a player’s treasury
each round if they are on a river tile, and 3D6 × 10 gold
pieces each round if they are on a mountain tile.

image::campaigns-of-conquest/artillery-column.png[]

==== Exhausting a mine

// Spelling e.g.
If all of the dice rolls are the same (e.g. you roll two 1’s
on a river, or three 5’s on a mountain) then the mine is
exhausted. Collect revenue as normal and then remove
the mine from the map, but leave the banner behind
to show who controls the tile. A new marker may be
created on the tile latter in the game if desired.

=== Challenge phase

Each player must issue a challenge to another player,
starting with the player with the smallest empire. The
challenger and the player they challenged must fight a
Warmaster battle in the battle phase. A player who has
been challenged cannot issue a challenge that round – his
army is already committed to battle!

==== Forming a team

A player can challenge a player who has already
been challenged to a battle. The player who has been
challenged can choose to either fight one battle against
all his challengers (see team battles), or he can choose
to fight a series of individual one–on-one battles against
each of his challengers in turn (see multiple battles). Any
number of players can form a team in this way.

==== Breaking up a team

A player can challenge a player who is already part of a
team – this will break the team up. For example, if Andy
and Phil had formed a team against Bob, then Max could
challenge one of them in order to break up the team.

// Spelling leaving
If you do this then the player you have
challenged fights a battle with you,
leaving the remaining team
member(s) to fight their opponent.
So, carrying on our example,
if Max challenges Phil,
then Max and Phil fight
a battle, leaving Andy to
fight against Bob.

=== Battle phase

// Spelling preferred
Players can agree to fight battles of whatever size they
find convenient – there is no need for all battles to be
fought at a preset size or with a pre-selected army list.
Just play Warmaster games as you normally would at
1000pts, 2000pts, 3000pts or whatever is your preferred
size.

==== Army bonuses

// Spelling receives
Each player receives a bonus to use when they select
their army.

* The player who has the largest empire receives
  a bonus of 1/40 of the total army points. So in
  2000pts battle he may field 2050pts, in 1000pts
  he may field 1025pts.

* Any player may spend up to 200 gold pieces
  from his treasury to add extra points to his
  army. For those 200 gold pieces he may add
  1/10 of total army points. So in 2000pts he may
  add 200 points, in 1000pts battle he may add 100
  points. If the player spends less then 200 gold
  pieces, the number of points is proportional.
  So if he spends 50 gold pieces in 2000pts battle,
  he may add 50 points, in 1000pts battle he may
  add 25 points.

==== Multiple battles

Sometimes a player will have to fight more than one
battle in a round (see challenges). A player can use all
bonuses they are entitled to in each and every battle they
fight that round. However, gold spent in one battle is
used up, and may not be used again in a later battle.

image::campaigns-of-conquest/dwarf-helmet.png[]

=== Team battles

Sometimes players will fight together as a team (see
challenge). When this happens the team must split the
total points value of their force between all the players in
the team in a mutually agreeable manner. For example in
2000pts game a two player team might take 1000 points
each, or one might take 1500 and the other 500 and so
on. Each player is then allowed to add bonuses to their
individual total as described above.

// Extra paragraph break removed
* Each player in a team controls his own army.
  Both players move their units in the movement
  phase, both
  players shoot in the shooting phase etc.

* Units may not charge, shoot or cast magic
  spells against units controlled by another
  player in the team.

* Characters form one army may not join units
  belonging to another team member’s army.

* Commanders can only command units from
  their army.

// Quote fixed
* Only units that belong to the same army
  count as “friendly units“ for the purpose of
  the rules. Units belonging to another team
  member’s army do not count as friendly units.

* In team battles the break point of each team
  army counts together, so both armies withdraw
  only when total break point is reached.

// Spelling its
* Each army has its own general. If one general
  is killed, his army doesn’t withdraw, however
  the team can no longer win the battle. It can
  only lose or draw. Commanders can only
  command their own armies and wizards can
  only cast bonus spells on their own troops.

=== Conquest and building phase

When you play a game of Warmaster you earn empire
points as shown on the chart below. Empire points are
used to take territory, to build cities, castles, ports or
mines or to remove territory from a rival player. Players
take it in turns to spend their empire points,
starting with the player with the
smallest empire and
working up.

==== Earning Empire Points

The number of empire points a player has to spend
depends on how well he did in the battle phase. Players
who lose earn 1 point, drawing players earn 2 points, and
winners earn 3, 4 or 5 depending upon level of victory.
Results of a battle are determined as follows:

* *Lose – 1 Empire Point.* Army is forced to
  withdraw while earning less victory points
  than the opponent OR army earns less victory
  points when no side withdraws. A player also
  loses when he willingly surrenders.

* *Draw – 2 Empire Points.* In case one army
  is forced to withdraw but gains more victory
  points than its opponent the battle is a draw
  and both armies get 2 EP. A player also gets
  2 EP when no side withdraws but they have
  more victory points than the opponent.

* *Minor victory – 3 Empire Points.* Army
  is victorious when it forces the enemy to
  withdraw and earns more victory points at the
  same time.

// Extra paragraph break removed
* *Major Victory – 4 Empire Points.* Army
  breaks the enemy while not losing more units
  than half of its
  break point.

* *Massacre – 5 Empire Points.* Army massacres
  an enemy when forcing him to withdraw
  while not losing more than 25% of its break
  point.

In a team game all players in a team earn one less empire
point (so if their side wins a victory each player earns 2
Empire points).

// 2,5 changed to 2½ to avoid decimal symbol
If a player fights more than one battle in a turn then he
must average out the empire points for the battles they
fought, rounding any fractions down. For example if a
player fights two battles, loses one and scores a major
victory in the other, then he would score (1+4)/2 = 2½,
rounded down to 2 empire points.

image::campaigns-of-conquest/territory-tiles.png[]

==== Spending Empire Points

// Spelling points
Empire Points can be spent as follows. Only one unused
empire point can be carried over to the next campaign
round.

* *Claim Tile (2 EP)* – place a banner on a tile
  without a banner that is adjacent to one of
  your own tiles.

* *Conquer Tile (3 EP)* – Remove another
  player’s banner from a tile that is adjacent to
  one of your own tiles and replace with your
  own. You must have fought and won a battle
  against the player in the preceding battle
  phase.

* *Build (1 EP)* – Add a castle, city, mine or port
  to a tile you already control (see Buildings).

* *Raids (1 EP)* – Player can raid a free territory
  in which case he gains 3D6 × 10 gold pieces.
  Alternatively he can raid territory of another
  player. He gains 2D6 × 10 gold pieces that are
  taken from the treasury of the player who’s
  territory was raided. You cannot get more gold
  pieces than the raided player actually has. You
  also cannot get the gold guarded in castles and
  cities (see Castles and Cities).

* *Plunder (2 EP)* – If you win a battle against
  another player, you can plunder one of his tiles.
  You don’t need to be bordering their territory.
  Choose one opponent’s tile. If there is a mine
  or port, remove them. If there is no building
  on the tile, remove opponent’s flag. Tiles with
  castles or cities cannot be plundered.

_Mountains_ – It costs 1 extra empire point to Claim or
Conquer a Mountain tile.

_Castles or Cities_ – It cost 1 extra empire point to Conquer
a tile that contains a castle or city.

_Buildings_ – You can spend empire points to add a castle,
city, mine or port to a tile that you control. Alternatively,
you may instead replace a marker on a tile you control
with another one. There can be only one building on
each tile.

==== Castle

Makes it more difficult for players to conquer the tile
(see above). Castles can also hold 25 gold pieces against
enemy raiders. Cannot be built on marsh tiles.

==== City

To build a city there must already be a castle on the tile.
You may upgrade a castle in the same turn that you build
it, and the city replaces the castle. The tile counts as
having a castle and in addition counts as two tiles when
working out who has the largest empire. Cities cannot
be built on mountain or marsh tiles.

==== Mine

Generates gold pieces in the revenue phase. Can only be
built on river or mountain tiles. You can spend gold from
your treasury to increase the point size of your army
in a battle (see Revenue phase). Gold mines on a river
generate 2D6 × 10 gold pieces, gold mines in a mountain
generate 3D6 × 10 gold pieces. Mines on tiles that were
conquered are destroyed.

==== Port

Can be built on river or shore tile (if you have any on
your map). Player with a port can claim and and conquer
river or shore tiles which are not adjacent to the player’s
own tiles.

==== *Objectives*

===== Mage Tower

Player who owns a tile with Mage Tower may add +1 to
the spell casting roll once per battle.

===== Dwarf Brewery

Player who owns a tile with Dwarf Brewery may once
per battle re-roll one save roll each round of a single
combat phase.

===== Orc Idol

Player who owns a tile with Orc Idol may once per battle
add D3 attack dice to a single unit during one combat
phase.

image::campaigns-of-conquest/territory-tile.png[]

== How to win

A player wins instantly when he claims his tenth tile
or if he knocks any other player out of the game by
conquering the last tile that player controls. Tiles that
contain a city count as two tiles for determining when a
player wins the game.

== Siege

A big advantage with Warmaster is that it has a well
written siege system. Because there are fortified places
such as castles and cities in the campaign system it would
be shame not to include a the possibility of siege battles.
To play a siege battle requires lots of special terrain
and models are needed (eg. fortress walls, siege towers,
ladders etc.). It may also slightly break the flow of the
campaign. For these reasons siege battles are considered
only as an option for players who want to play it. There
is no need to play siege battles in your campaign if you
don’t want to. Siege battles are played only when both
players agree to do so.

=== Into the breach!

When a player wins a battle and decides to conquer a
loser’s tile with a castle or city, he can do it either in the
standard way or, if both players agree, they can start
a siege. When players decide to start a siege, the tile is
conquered for 2 EP as usual, however the
castle or city
remains in the defender’s hands. This tile counts as a half
of a tile for both players for the purpose of determining
the largest empire.

// Spelling conquer
The situation remains the same until the castle/city is
conquered or the whole map tile is conquered back. To
conquer the castle/city both players must play a siege
battle (Into the breach! scenario in Siege and fortresses
section). In this scenario the conquering player is the
attacker of course. If the besieger wins the siege battle,
he conquers the whole tile. If he fails, the siege goes on.
One such attempt to conquer the castle/city can be made
per campaign round.

// Spelling conquer
Until the castle/city is conquered the defender has
a chance to conquer the map tile back in the usual
manner. No extra 1 EP is needed to pay for conquering
a tile with a castle or city on it as it is being held by own
troops.

image::campaigns-of-conquest/fortress-gate.png[]

image::campaigns-of-conquest/dwarf-axes-left.png[]

== Naval operations

Another option to spice a campaign up is to add ship
battles on sea. Main task of fleets in a campaign is to
support ground operation on shores. Of course this
is only possible when your map includes a sea. The
main problem is that ship battles are not included in
Warmaster rules and so you would need to play them
using some stand-alone rule system with its own models
(eg. old Man O’War game or Armada). For this reason
the naval operation rules are optional and can be used
only when at least two players agree on that.

=== Set sails!

Naval operations can only take place at sea, not on
rivers. Players who agreed on involving naval operations
can challenge each other to fight sea battles in the same
manner as in ordinary ground battles. Sea battles are
fought in Battle sequence no matter the order.

// Spelling conquer
A player who wins a sea battle gets a Naval Advantage
over the defeated player. Naval Advantage means you
can conquer a shore tile of the player defeated at sea
for 1 EP less (usually 2) while it costs 1 EP more for the
defeated player to conquer a shore tile (usually 4) of the
player who has Naval Advantage over him. Note that a
player still has to defeat another player in a Warmaster
battle in order to conquer his shore tiles.

The Naval Advantage only makes it easier or more
difficult depending on the situation at sea.

The Naval Advantage is carried over into subsequent
campaign rounds and lasts until the player with the
advantage is defeated in naval battle by any involved
player. Involved players with no shore ports can still
fight sea battles for Naval Advantage, however they
cannot conquer another player’s shore tiles until a sea
port is built.

.Optional rules
****
These rules are designed to give a player an additional tool to turn the probability of success in their favour at critical
moments of the battle.

[discrete]
==== General’s abilities

// Spelling situations
In the most critical of situations, a General can try to focus all his efforts to avert some dire event, or the mishaps of
his subordinates. There are two abilities a General can use in such situations. Each of these Abilities can be used once
per game.

*Reliable Courier:* One Hero or Wizard within 30cm of the General can re-roll a failed order.

*Inspection of Arms:* One friendly unit within 30cm of the General can re-roll all dice for either one to-hit roll or armour
roll.
****

.Abstract battle resolution
****
// Change to "whatever the reason"
To keep a campaign going players must be active.
However there are situations when even the most
enthusiastic players cannot find free time to play a battle,
whatever the reason.

In case a player cannot fight a battle against his
opponent(s) he can either find a volunteer to fight it for
him (no matter what army he uses) or he can use the
Abstract Battle Resolution system. This system is
designed to decide the battle with just simple dice roll.
This can happen online in a virtual dice room.

In this roll-off the challenger is considered the attacker
and the challenged player is the defender. First find out a
strategy bonuses your army has:

[cols="5,^2,^2",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Strategy Bonus |Attacker |Defender

|Elite army     |+1       |−1
|Scouts         |+1       |−1
|Largest empire |+1       |−1
|Each 100 GP
spent (max 200) |+1       |−1
|===

[discrete]
==== Roll for the outcome

// "A" added
A third person who is not involved in the battle rolls 2D6
and applies any strategy bonuses. High result favours the
attacker, low result favours the defender.

[cols="2,^2",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Adjusted die roll |Result

|2 or less         |Defender major victory
|3–5               |Defender minor victory
|6–8               |Draw
|9–11              |Attacker minor victory
|12 or more        |Attacker major victory
