= Flying units

Troops and monsters who are able to fly can move
long distances very quickly. However, once airborne
they are almost impossible to direct, so such troops must
be deployed and committed to battle with care.

== Initiative

A flying unit can use its initiative to charge an enemy
within 20cm. In this respect it’s like any other unit.

Flying troops don’t evade as ground based troops do.
This is because they are allowed to home back instead.
Homing back is explained below.

== Orders

A flying unit can only be issued orders by a character
within 20cm. This restricted range reflects the difficulty
of issuing orders to troops that are airborne.

== Home back

Flying units more than 20cm from a character at the
start of the Command phase can choose to move up to
1D6 × 10 cm towards any character after initiative moves
have been made but *before* any orders are issued. This is
called a home back move. The player can roll for distance
before deciding whether or where to home back to.

A unit can home back and be given orders in the same
Command phase if it homes back to within 20cm of a
character.

A unit can home back even if confused and therefore
normally barred from moving, although such a unit
cannot be given an order in that Command phase.

Unless affected by a spell that prevents movement,
flyers can always home back if the player wishes. This
is because airborne units are isolated from broader
events and their natural reaction to not knowing what
is going on is to home back rather than stand around in
confusion. Once the player has decided where to home
back, move the unit towards the nominated character.
If the dice roll is greater than the distance between the
unit and character move the unit directly towards the
character stand and into touch.

Otherwise, move the unit the full distance rolled towards
the character. If this isn’t possible due to the presence of
other units or restrictive terrain, move the flyers as far
as possible. The nearest stand is placed first – the other
stands are placed around the first. No stand may be
placed nearer to the character than the first. No stand
may change orientation along their way. Flyers cannot
be placed into touch with enemy stands when they home
back.

== Moving

When flying units move in the Command phase they can
move over other units, including other units of flyers,
whether friend or foe. They can also move over terrain
as noted below. Flying units cannot end their move
touching enemy units unless they have charged, nor can
they end their move on top of other friendly stands –
stands must have room to be positioned in the same way
as units on the ground.

Flying units move up to 100cm when moving under
orders. However when charging, flyers can move only
up to 60cm. Once a flying unit has moved, it is treated
exactly like a ground based unit and can therefore be
shot at, charged or attacked with magic in the normal
way. However, certain special rules apply regarding
terrain as noted below. Also note, that flying units can
only move *half pace* (up to 10cm) when charging from
irregular formation which is an exception to the normal
rules.

== What can flying units see?

When working out if a flying unit can see an enemy, for
shooting or charging for example, treat the flying unit
exactly as you would a unit on the ground. Even though
a flying unit can fly over another unit, or over terrain
such as a wood, flying stands still can’t see through other
stands or obstructive terrain. This forces flying units to
move towards their targets rather than simply bouncing
enemy units out of the blue, and it enables enemy units
to avoid aerial attack if they have screening units or if
there is plenty of terrain.

== Terrain

When flyers move in the Command phase they ignore
terrain altogether because they fly right over it. This
means they can move over terrain that is impassable
to other troops such as sheer cliffs, wide rivers, and so
forth.

Although flyers can move over all kinds of terrain
they cannot end their move in any kind of terrain
that would be impassable to infantry, or over woods.
The restriction for woods is because we imagine it is
practically impossible for flyers to operate effectively
amongst trees. The general restriction for other kinds
of impassable terrain is because we have chosen to
treat flyers as ‘hopping’ from position to position rather
than remaining airborne from move to move. Although
this may seem a little arbitrary, it is necessary to avoid
complexity and ambiguity in other aspects of the game,
and it is a very practical way of representing flyers.

=== Moving in the shooting and combat phases

Flyers that are driven back by shooting will move over
interposing stands and terrain in the same way as in the
Command phase. Driven back flyers that end their move
positioned over impassable terrain will stop in front of
it in the same way as ground troops. Driven back flyers
that end their move positioned over friendly units are
treated exactly like ground troops – i.e.; friends can
make way or, if they do not do so, the flyers halt as they
touch. Driven back flyers that end their move positioned
over enemy will come to a stop 1cm in front of them in
the same way as ground troops. In all cases appropriate
tests must be made for confusion (see xref:confusion.adoc[Confusion]).

In the Combat phase flying units that are retreating or
pursuing make all moves along the ground, and their
moves will be blocked by other stands, terrain that is
impassable to infantry, or woods. This represents the
fact that flyers are operating at ground level and that in
reality these moves are progressive and can be thought of
as occurring during the fighting. In cases where flyers are
destroyed because they retreat into enemy or impassable
terrain it may be more convincing to think of the unit as
routed or dispersed rather than actually slain. For our
purposes this amounts to the same thing so the unit can
be removed from the game.

Flying units that are advancing or falling back in the
Combat phase are treated as during the Command phase
and can therefore fly over terrain and stands.

== Fortified troops

Flying units can attack fortified units as well as units
within castle courtyards and similar places. Fortified
units still count as fortified to attack from the air. It
is assumed that ramparts have hoardings and other
fortifications which offer sufficient shelter to protect
them from aerial attack.

== Characters

If a General, Wizard or Hero rides a flying Monstrous
Mount, such as a Dragon or Griffon, his fighting ability
is vastly improved. The stand’s maximum movement is
increased to 100cm and the Attack bonus of the monster
is added to the character’s.

A character riding a flying monster is bound by the
terrain movement restrictions that apply for flying
monsters. See xref:generals-wizards-and-heroes.adoc[Generals, Wizards and Heroes].

If a lone flying character has to move to a friendly unit
as a result of enemy contact he can move 30cm to reach
safety in time. In this case, his move is not increased
because he rides a flying creature. If there is no friendly
unit he can join within 30cm, he is slain.

If a flying character joins a unit in combat, he must
remain with it as it fights but if the unit retreats, falls
back, pursues or advances into terrain which the
character cannot enter then he must move to another
unit in the same way as a lone character contacted by the
enemy. He can move up to 30cm and if he is unable to
reach a friendly unit he is slain.

.Optional rule
****
In the Command phase, flying units must end their
movement more than 1cm away from enemy units
unless charging.
