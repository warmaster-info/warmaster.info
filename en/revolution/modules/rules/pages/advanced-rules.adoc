= Advanced Rules

Once you’ve reached this far, you will have read
all of the basic rules of the Warmaster game. The
following section introduces new rules to cover magic,
engines of destruction, ways to improve the fighting
qualities of your armies and, for the very ambitious, we’ll
discuss how to fight entire campaigns of conquest. You
don’t need to use any of these rules to play Warmaster
but they do make the game more fun. We’d recommend
that you fight a few games using only the core rules to
familiarise yourselves with the way that the game works.
Once accustomed to the basic routines, further rules can
be introduced as you wish.

== The aim of the game

The advanced rules in this section describe ways of
extending the Warmaster game to cover new weapons,
campaigns and scenarios. Unlike the earlier sections
of this book, many of these themes are presented in
a discursive fashion so that players can decide for
themselves how to develop their Warmaster battles. This
might strike some readers as a little odd in a book of
gaming rules but Warmaster is no ordinary game.

Most other games provide fixed and finite rules and
leave very little up to the players themselves. Warmaster
invites players to change, invent, expand and super-detail
the rules to their liking. Indeed, it would be impossible
for us to provide rules for every single imaginable aspect
of warfare or which would accommodate everyone’s
individual tastes. Players are positively
encouraged to invent their own rules, to change bits
they don’t like and to expand the game to suit their own
purposes. For example, you might wish to represent novel
and potent sorceries, or vast and exotic war machines of
your own devising. You might have a burning desire to
fight games which involve shipboard action on the high
seas, waterborne assaults, lengthy sieges, aerial warfare
between soaring beasts, whirling machines and so
forth. All of this would require some effort and no little
imagination but lies well within the capabilities of the
experienced gamer.

== The spirit of the game

Winning isn’t the most important thing, honest! Sure,
we all want to win but we want to do so with superior
tactics, well taken decisions and just a little luck, not by
bickering over the rules or bullying our opponents into
compliance. The really important thing is that all the
players involved have a good time.

If players find themselves quibbling over a particular rule
or are confused over how to proceed, it is best to agree
what to do and get on with the game. Later, once the heat
of battle has cooled, there will be plenty of opportunity
for the players to check over the rulebook or come up
with a new rule of their own to apply in future. If you
really are stuck and can’t agree what to do then roll a
dice to decide which interpretation to apply. This might
seem arbitrary but it is fair and keeps the game going
where it might otherwise bog down.
