= Editor’s note

Warmaster Revolution (WMR) is a fan-based 2nd edition of rules for the Warmaster game.
Warmaster stopped being supported by Games Workshop (GW) in 2012, yet there are still
many players around the world who love this game and are playing it regularly.

WMR first started as a Czech community-based project but has since evolved into a project
supported by large parts of the international community. The Warmaster Revolution Rules
Committee (WMRRC), consisting of a number of players from around the world, was established
to discuss rules issues and potential changes to the army lists.

The main aim of the WMR rule set is to implement the combat system from Warmaster
Ancients – a second generation of the Warmaster rules system. In brief, this means a limi-
ted amount of combat rounds within one Combat Phase, among many other small fixes
and enhancements. WMR also features a set of optional rules that focus on adding more
dynamics to the game. Finally, a number of minor changes have also been introduced into
the existing army lists.

We believe that WMR offers more dynamic, smooth and “realistic” games than the original
version. But most importantly it shows, that though not supported by GW any more, the
game still lives on.

== Website editor’s note

*This is an unofficial website not associated with the Warmaster Rules Committee.*

Most of the text on this website is copied verbatim from the https://drive.google.com/file/d/10DNg5O4glnBE2T7p-tZBH2oClyj2Ib71/view?usp=sharing[WMR Compendium version 2.0.1], available from the https://www.wm-revolution.com/articles/download.html[Warmaster Revolution website].

Changes to improve the text are marked with dotted underlines.  **These changes are not modifying any rules.**
They improve the rulebook by rearranging some sections to introduce concepts in a better order, and add
clarifications included in later versions of the _Warmaster_ game.  For example, Initiative movement is described in the Command phase (where it happens) rather than at the end of the Movement section.

Minor spelling and grammatical errors have also been corrected.  These corrections are not indicated —
some of them are even present in the original rulebooks.  Small changes to adapt the text for a website are also unmarked, for example replacing page references and diagram numbers with hyperlinks.
