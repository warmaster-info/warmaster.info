= Confusion

As astute readers will have gathered, there are several situations where units become confused.
Confusion often happens in the Combat phase when a unit is forced to move into other troops or
impassable terrain or in the Shooting phase when a unit is driven back by missile fire. For convenience,
we have summarised all the circumstances where units can become confused in this section.

== When do units become confused?

. *Burst through by evaders.*
+
Unengaged friendly units burst through by evaders are
automatically confused. Such units won’t be able to
move further during that Command phase but recover at
the end of the Command phase and so suffer no further
penalties that turn. See the xref:movement.adoc#the-path-of-evaders[Movement section] for
more details.

. *Driven back by shooting.*
+
A unit is confused if it is driven back by shooting and any
dice roll for the drive back distance is a 6. See the rules
for xref:the-shooting-phase.adoc#driving-back-enemies[driving back enemies] in the Shooting phase section.

. *Driven back/falling back into impassable terrain.*
+
If a unit is driven back by shooting into terrain it can’t
cross, or is unable to avoid falling back into terrain it
can’t cross, it will halt at the edge and is confused on the
D6 roll of a 6. See xref:the-shooting-phase.adoc#driving-back-enemies[driving back enemies] in the Shooting
phase section.

. *Driven back/falling back into enemies or combat.*
+
A unit driven back by shooting into, or unable to avoid
falling back into, enemies or any units engaged in
combat, whether friends or foe, halts 1cm away and is
automatically confused. See xref:the-shooting-phase.adoc#driving-back-enemies[driving back enemies] in the
Shooting phase section.

. *Unable to Fall back to 1cm from enemy or combat*
+
If unit Falls Back from combat and is unable to move
so that it is at least 1cm from any enemy unit, or any
friendly unit that is engaged in combat, then it is confused
automatically.

. *Forcing friends to make way.*
+
If a unit is driven back by shooting, retreats from combat,
or is unable to avoid falling back, through a friendly
unengaged unit, the player has the option of moving
the friendly unit to make way. A unit which moves into
friends forcing them to make way will become confused
on the D6 roll of a 6. See the rules for <<making-way>>
later in this section.

. *Driven back through friends who do not make way.*
+
A unit driven back by shooting so that it intersects
a friendly unengaged unit that the player is unable
or unwilling to move to make way is automatically
confused. The unit that has been driven back halts
upon contact; the friendly unit does not have to roll for
confusion as it is not making way.

. *Making way.*
+
A unit that makes way for another unit is confused on
the D6 roll of a 6. See the rules for <<making-way>>
later in this section.
+
Stands which are forced to retreat from combat into
unyielding friends, enemies, units in combat and
impassable terrain are destroyed. Hence the possibility
of confusion is not considered! See the Combat phase
section for details on xref:combat-phase.adoc#retreats[retreats from combat].
+
Note that it is quite possible that a unit has to roll
multiple times for confusion as a result of a single move
– for example, for making way and for forcing friends to
make way at the same time. In these situations make the
appropriate number of tests.

== Confused units

A confused unit is judged to have become disheartened
or disordered. The troops are unwilling or unable to
obey their officers and in combat they fight either
unenthusiastically or in a poorly coordinated fashion.
The unit remains confused until the end of its Command
phase. At the end of its Command phase the unit
automatically recovers.

. A unit which is confused cannot use Initiative and it
  cannot be issued Orders. This means that a confused
  unit will not usually be able to move at all in the
  Command phase. See the xref:the-command-phase.adoc[Command phase]
  and xref:flying-units.adoc[Flying Units]. Note that confused units are
  able to move in other phases and must do so where
  the rules require it.

. Whilst it is confused, a unit suffers a -1 Attack
  modifier in combat. Units commonly become
  confused during combat if retreating units are
  forced back into unengaged friends. See the xref:combat-phase.adoc#retreats[Combat
  phase].

. A confused infantry unit cannot support in combat.
  See the xref:combat-phase.adoc#supporting-troops[Combat phase].

When a unit becomes confused, it is a good idea to
make this visually apparent in some way. A convenient
method is to ‘jiggle’ the stands into an irregular
formation to represent disorder in the ranks. The unit
can then be rearranged back into formation at the end
of its Command phase. If a confused unit is in combat
it is often better to use a marker or turn a stand round,
as disturbing the unit’s formation may make it hard to
work out retreat moves.

== Making way

Unengaged units are allowed to make way for friendly
troops that have been driven back, that are retreating or
that are themselves making way as a result of a drive back
or retreat. Units that are engaged in combat, constricted
by terrain or unable to move for whatever reason cannot
make way.

When a unit makes way, stands can move up to the
normal move distance for their formation. When a unit
makes way, it can either *move aside* or *move back*.

=== Moving aside

When moving aside, all stands in the path of the friendly
unit are moved and all other stands remain stationary.
The player rearranges the stands that move around
the stands that remain stationary. If the entire unit
lies within the path of the friendly unit then all stands
must be moved, in this case the player begins with the
stand that must move the shortest distance to get out of
the path of its friends. This stand is moved the shortest
distance out of the path of its friends without changing
its orientation. The remaining stands are then rearranged
into formation around the first. Note that units that are
moving aside can change their formation as they do so.
See <<f-moving-aside>>.

=== Moving back

When moving back, a unit simply keeps pace with its
friend and moves in the same direction. The move doesn‘t
necessarily need to be to the unit‘s ‘back‘. In the case of
infantry units that are making way for other infantry
units when all the stands of the unit that is making way
lie in the path of the friendly unit, it can be moved behind
its friends and stands can be arranged into support. See
<<f-move-back>>.

Making way for friendly troops may result in several
units shifting, each moving aside to allow room for
the next unit. All units that move to make way, plus
the original unit, must test for confusion as described
already. The original unit will have to test for each unit
that it forces to make way, so the more units it moves
through the more likely it is to become confused.

Units making way cannot move into contact with enemies
or units engaged in combat. Otherwise, the usual rules
apply, eg. units cannot move over impenetrable terrain,
must maintain formation, and so on.

Units which are unable to make way or which the
player refuses to move to make way are considered to
be ‘unyielding friends’. A unit forced against unyielding
friends halts on contact and becomes confused
automatically (see <<when-do-units-become-confused,earlier>>). A unit retreating from combat
is destroyed if forced into unyielding friends (see xref:combat-phase.adoc#blocked-retreats[Combat, blocked retreats].

// Spelling necessarily
Note that making way does sometimes give units the
opportunity to redress formations to their benefit.
Making way is not necessarily a disadvantage other
than the attendant risk of confusion.
