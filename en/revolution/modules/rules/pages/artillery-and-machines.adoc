= Artillery & Machines

This section covers cannons, stone and bolt throwing
war engines. Both artillery and machines share
some rules in common, so we’ve included them together
to avoid taking up more space than necessary. Special
artillery units and machines will be described in
particular armylists.

*Artillery* describes crewed weapons such as cannons,
Stone Throwers, Flame Cannons, etc. In most cases,
these are arranged into units called *batteries*; a typical
battery consisting of two individual weapons.

*Machines* describes unusual devices such as Steam Tanks
and Gyrocopters. Each model is invariably a single unit
in its own right.

== Stands

Artillery pieces are mounted on stands which include
the weapon itself plus any necessary crew. For our
purposes, the two are inseparable. After all, an artillery
piece without its crew is useless and crewmen without a
weapon are an embarrassment.

Machine models are based on a single stand.

== Artillery in combat

// See the Command phase p.13–17. removed as there's nothing particular to artillery here
Artillery cannot use initiative to charge. The role of
artillery is to shoot at the enemy from a distance, not to
fight. A player can order artillery to charge into combat
if he wants, although this is rather a desperate thing to
do!

Artillery is vulnerable in combat. An artillery unit that
wins a round of combat never pursues and if it retreats it
is automatically destroyed.

Machines are more complex then artillery and some
have their own rules for fighting in combat, as described
in particular army lists.

== Terrain

As discussed in xref:movement.adoc#terrain[Movement – Terrain], artillery cannot move
into or over terrain features on the battlefield except for
hills and bridges. Any other type of terrain is impassable
to artillery.

Except where noted, machines treat terrain in the same
way as chariots. Some machines have special rules of
their own, as described in individual army lists.

== Shooting overhead

As we described in the Shooting section, stands cannot
see through other stands. Consequently, missile-armed
troops cannot shoot through or over a friendly stand to
attack an enemy. Technically speaking, the stand’s ‘line
of sight’ is blocked and it is unable to fire.

Whilst this is perfectly true and satisfactory for the
majority of troops, when it comes to artillery fire it is
felt that an exception is called for. After all, is it not
appropriate that cannons, stone throwing engines
and the like should lob their missiles over the heads
of intervening troops onto the enemy? Obviously, it
is of great benefit to crew if they can see where their
missiles land but we can conveniently assume that there
are forward observers placed in strategic positions to
observe the fall of shot and somehow communicate any
targeting information back to the crew.

Artillery stands that are positioned on high ground can
shoot over the top of intervening troops on a lower level.
Artillery stands can shoot over the top of intervening
troops on the same or higher level if the target is on a
higher level still. In both cases intervening troops includes
all friendly units and any enemy units that are ineligible
as targets – for example, because they are engaged in
combat. Enemy units that are eligible as targets cannot
be shot over because they have to be shot at – artillery
being obliged to shoot at the closest viable target in
the same way as other shooters. Eg, artillery placed on
top of a hill can shoot over friendly stands and combat
engagements on lower ground. However, it cannot shoot
over intervening terrain such as woods, build-up areas
and similar terrain features that block line of sight.

Artillery placed on the ramparts of a castle or upper
storey of a watch tower is assumed to be higher than the
corresponding ground level of the fortress wall or tower.

== Cannons

These are large calibre guns that fire a heavy cannon
ball. Gunpowder weapons like these are primitive and
unreliable compared to the tried and trusted technology
of stone throwers and the like. Only Dwarf smiths and
a few weapon makers in the Empire can build these
devices. These wild and determined individuals can be
recognised by their dense covering of soot and lack of
eyebrows.

Cannons ignore a target’s Armour because no armour
can nullify a hit caused by a cannon ball. No Armour roll
is made. In addition, fortified targets only count as being
defended (5+ to hit) and defended targets count as being
in the open (4+ to hit).

Cannon balls can bounce through densely packed ranks
causing immense destruction. To represent this, a shot
is deemed to strike the closest point of the target stand,
pass all the way through it and bounce a further 5cm in
the same direction. If more than one cannon from the
same unit is shooting then both cannon balls are assumed
to bounce the same distance through the path between
the closest cannon and closest target stand. The target
unit suffers two attacks plus +1 for each additional stand
from the same unit that is bounced through.

image::artillery-and-machines/cannon-shot.svg[id=cannon-shot]

A shot that bounces into a different unit inflicts one
attack on that unit for each stand bounced through. This
can result in units normally ineligible as targets being
hit, such as friendly units or units in combat. Total up
the number of attacks struck and roll for all the attacks
against each unit at a time.

If a cannon is charged it can shoot at the enemy by firing
‘grapeshot’. Like cannon balls, grapeshot has an Attack
value of 2 but it doesn’t bounce and targets shot at by
grapeshot count their full Armour value – armour is not
discounted as it is with a cannon ball.

Although grapeshot is pretty effective compared to,
say, a shot from a single archer stand, it is actually less
effective than ordinary cannon fire. At first glance
this may seem wrong. After all, shouldn’t grapeshot
be devastating compared to normal cannon fire? The
reason for this is not that we’ve made grapeshot weak
but that normal cannon fire represents not a single shot
but a continuous bombardment in which dozens of balls
are fired by each cannon. Grapeshot, on the other hand,
represents just one hurried blast at close quarters, far
more deadly than a single cannon ball which could easily
sail over the enemy formation or pass between the ranks
but not as deadly as a rain of well aimed cannon balls
over a longer period.

Because cannons can cause additional damage by
bouncing shots, it is possible to inflict hits upon friends or
upon units from either side that are engaged in combat.
Both of these are normally ineligible targets, but in the
case of bouncing cannon shots they can suffer hits as a
result of fire directed nearby. Any friendly unengaged
units that take hits from cannons are driven back as if
taking enemy fire. Where friendly units are driven back
in this way wait until all drive backs for enemy units
have been completed, and then work out drive backs
for friendly units. Any engaged units taking hits from
cannons will carry hits forward into the combat round
and hits count as having been struck during that round
for purposes of working out which side wins. Units
engaged in combat are not driven back by any hits taken
– carrying hits forward takes this into account.

== Elven bolt thrower

This elegant device was devised many years ago by the
High Elves for use onboard their ships. Since then it has
become a feature of many Elven armies and is sometimes
known as the ‘Reaper’ because of its deadly effect. The
machine throws a hail of light weight bolts, ideal for
raking the decks of enemy ships or the ranks of enemy
regiments.

The Elven Bolt Thrower can shoot at a charging
enemy in the same way as a missile-armed infantry or
cavalry unit. Unlike many artillery pieces, the Elven
Bolt Thrower does not automatically pierce its target’s
armour. Enemies take their Armour rolls as normal. The
Elven Bolt Thrower’s darts are relatively small and light
compared to say, the Undead Bone Thrower’s.

== Stone throwers

Stone Throwers are big machines which employ a system
of counterweights or torsion power to chuck either one
big rock, several small rocks or what (or whoever) takes
your fancy. These stone throwing machines are favoured
by greenskins because they are
simple to build from readily available materials. Because
Stone Throwers lob rocks of such immense size no
armour can protect against them. Even the most heavily
armoured knight would be instantly pulped if a boulder
the size of a horse were to land on him. To represent
this, targets always ignore their armour when shot at by
a Stone Thrower. No Armour roll is made.

Stone Throwers shoot with such a high trajectory that
they cannot shoot at charging enemies.

Because of the high trajectory Stone Throwers can shoot
blind at targets they cannot see. The targets are assumed
to be reported by scouts or messengers from other units.
If there is no target in sight a Stone Thrower may instead
shoot at the nearest enemy unit in range it cannot see.
When shooting blind it always hits on 6+ no matter if the
target is in the open, defended or even fortified.

== Bolt thrower

A Bolt Thrower is a device fashioned to hurl large missiles
upon the enemy. It is essentially a big crossbow... a very
big crossbow indeed! The missiles it fires are as long as
spears and can skewer a whole line of troops.

Targets always ignore their armour when shot at by a Bolt
Thrower. No Armour roll is made. The Bolt Thrower’s
heavy dart can pierce even the thickest armour.

When you shoot with a Bolt Thrower it will strike up to
two touching stands within the missile’s line of flight.
These can be stands from the same or a different unit
– the missile will automatically pass through and strike
up to two stands so long as they are touching along the
missile’s path.

The target unit suffers two attacks plus +1 for additional
stand from the same unit within the missile’s path. A
shot that skewer into a different unit inflicts one attack
on that unit. All attacks against the same unit are rolled
at once – for example, an infantry unit in column takes
three attacks so roll three dice.

Because a bolt thrower can cause hits on different units by
skewering shots, it is possible to inflict hits upon enemy
units that are engaged in combat. These are normally
ineligible targets, but in the case of skewering shots
they can suffer hits as a result of fire directed at a unit
touching another enemy unit. Any engaged units from
either side taking hits from Bolt Throwers will carry hits
forward into the combat round and hits count as having
been struck during that round for purposes of working
out which side wins. Units engaged in combat are not
driven back by any hits taken – carrying hits forward
takes this into account. Units that are not engaged are
driven back in the usual way.

Bolt Throwers can shoot at a charging enemy and can do
so at any point as the enemy charges, including the start
of the move or when the charger has reached its final
position.
