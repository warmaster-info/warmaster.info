= The Command Phase

Units [.bo5a]#and characters are# usually moved in the Command phase. A unit
usually requires orders before it will move but if
the enemy is very close, a unit is able to react directly
to its presence. Otherwise, if a unit receives no orders it
remains where it is and awaits further instructions.
[.bo5a]#Characters do move automatically and do so after all unit movement is complete.#

The Command phase proceeds in the following sequence
[.bo5a]#of sub-phases. Of these, the Home Back sub-phase only applies to
flying units and so is not considered further in this section, see
xref:flying-units.adoc[]#.

[.bo5a]#A unit cann ot move by means of initiative *and* orders in the same
turn. If a unit moves by initiative in the Initiative sub-phase, it
*cannot* be given orders in the Orders sub-phase.#

[.bo5a]#Note that all units moving by initiative must be moved before
any orders are issued. Once a character has issued an order, the
Orders sub-phase has begun and no further units can move by
initiative.#

[.bo5a]#The distances moved by each type of unit vary, and are given in
the Movement section.#

== Initiative movement

Units within 20cm of the enemy at the start of the
Command phase can use their initiative to move without
orders. They do not have to do so – it is up to the player
to decide whether to use initiative or to issue an order. If
the player requires any of his units to use their initiative,
they must do so *before* any orders are issued.

Before we concern ourselves further with initiative
movement, we need to understand how ordered
movement works. For this reason, an explanation of
initiative movement and further rules for it are given in
the Movement section of the rulebook.

== Ordered movement

Issuing orders is one of the most important features
of Warmaster. An order is given to a unit to enable it
to move. Once a unit has moved, another unit may be
given an order and moved and so on. This represents the
process of relaying instructions by messenger, or a local
commander’s interpretation of orders either given by
signal or arranged before the battle.

Orders are issued by Generals, Wizards and Heroes,
collectively known as characters. Specific rules for
Generals, Wizards and Heroes are given in the xref::generals-wizards-and-heroes.adoc[Generals,
Wizards & Heroes section of the rulebook].

== Giving an order

The player begins giving an order by choosing a unit
which he wishes to move. He must then take a dice test
to determine if the order is received and acted upon. This
works in the following way:

// Spelling i.e.
Roll 2D6 (i.e., roll two dice and add the results to get a
score of between 2 and 12). If the score is equal to or less
than the character’s Command value then the unit has
received its order and can move full pace. If the score
is more than the character’s Command value then the
unit has not received its order and can move only half
pace (see xref::movement[Movement]). This represents unit’s
commanders being able to act on their own to some
limited extent.

Once a character has begun to issue orders, he must
finish issuing all of his orders before another character
can start to do so. It is not permitted for a character to
issue an order, then a different character to issue one,
then the first character again.

.Command values
****
This table shows the Command values for different
Generals. As you can see, there are three basic
values and some are better than others.

[cols="<,>",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|High Elf  |10
|Dwarf     |10
|Empire    |9
|Tomb King |9
|Chaos     |9
|Orc       |8
|===
****

Once a character has failed to give an order, he cannot
issue any more orders in that Command phase. Once the
General has failed to give an order, no further orders
can be issued by any other characters in that Command
phase even if they have not done so already.
The character has run out of time, the distance
between him and the unit he is issuing orders
to is too great for his signals to be
discerned, or the message may have been
lost or confused (perhaps the
messenger has been caught up in
nearby enemy action and killed).

=== Giving further orders

When a unit is given an order, it moves to a new position.
Usually this enables the unit to move 20cm if it is infantry
or 30cm if cavalry, but some troops move at different
speeds as we shall see later.

image::the-command-phase/skinks.png[]

Once a unit has moved, the character can give it a further
order to move again or he can attempt to give an order to
a different unit. However, he is not permitted to go back
to a previously moved unit once he has moved another
unit. Nor is a different character permitted to give a unit
an order if that unit has already been given an order that
turn, even if the order was failed. This is an important
rule so it is worth remembering right from the start. If
you want to move a unit several times, the character must
finish ordering it to move completely before he can try to
issue an order to a different unit. Note that a unit can be
given up to a maximum of *three* orders in succession. A
unit failing to receive a *further* order *cannot* move at all.

The player continues issuing orders and moving his units
until he no longer wishes to move or until he can issue no
more orders. It is possible to fail to issue any orders at all
during a Command phase, although this happens rarely.
More commonly, a player might manage to move only
one or two units before a dice roll ends movement. This
represents the confusion of battle, the indecisiveness
of unit leaders, occasional stupidity and all those other
annoying things that bedevil the process of waging war.

== Command penalties

Circumstances can sometimes make it harder to issue an
order. For example, a unit might be a far distant speck on
the horizon or it might be obscured within dense terrain.
All of these things make it harder for the character to
identify what is going on and less likely that an effective
order will be formulated or received. To represent this,
we apply the following penalties:

// Reformatted similar to Bo5A

=== [.bo5a]#Distance#

If the distance between the character and the unit you
wish to move is more than 20cm, the character suffers a
Command penalty of −1 per full 20cm of distance. When
measuring distances between characters and units in this
way, measure the shortest distance between them.

[cols="^,^",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Distance to Unit |Command Penalty

|Up to 20cm  |none
|Up to 40cm  |−1
|Up to 60cm  |−2
|Up to 80cm  |−3
|per +20cm   |minus a further 1
|===

=== [.bo5a]#Multiple orders#

If a unit has already been issued an order during the
Command phase then there is a Command penalty of
−1 each time the character gives it a further order. This
accounts for fatigue and the limits of time, so a unit
which has already moved several times is harder to move
again. This penalty is cumulative, so a unit’s second order
is at −1, its third order is at −2 [.bo5a]#and so on#.

[cols="^,^",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Order  |Command Penalty

|First  |none
|Second |−1
|Third  |−2
// Bo5A
|[.bo5a]#Fourth# |[.bo5a]#−3#
// Bo5A
|[.bo5a]#Each additional#  |[.bo5a]#minus a further 1#
|===

=== [.bo5a]#Enemy close#

If the distance between the unit you wish to move
and the closest enemy unit is 20cm or less, there is a
Command penalty of −1. Units close to the enemy are
naturally inclined to use their initiative to react, so it is
harder to give them a specific order.
[.bo5a]#This penalty applies even if the unit is not visible
(after all if you can’t see it, how do you know it isn’n there?).#

[cols="^,^",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Closest Enemy  |Command Penalty

|Up to 20cm     |−1
|More than 20cm |none
|===

=== [.bo5a]#Dense terrain#

If the unit you want to move is in dense terrain then
there is a Command penalty of −1
[.bo5a]#(Only infantry units can normally enter dense terrain as described later)#.
The penalty applies if
at least one stand is even partially within dense terrain.
Typical dense terrain features are woods, in and around
buildings, ruins and similar. See the xref::movement.adoc#terrain[Movement section
for more about dense terrain] as well as xref::advanced-terrain-rules.adoc[Advanced
Terrain Rules] for more examples.

[cols="^,^",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Dense Terrain  |Command Penalty

|Within feature |−1
|===

=== [.bo5a]#Casualties#

If the unit has lost one or more stands as casualties
then there is a Command penalty of −1 per stand lost.
Units which have suffered casualties are harder to
motivate than fresh units.

[cols="^,^",frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Casualties  |Command Penalty

|Each Stand  |−1
|===

// Example extended based on Bo5A, since it shows
// a) two commands
// b) a new unit isn't affected by multiple orders (starts again at 9)
// c) failure ends

_[.bo5a]#Example: The General has a Command value of 9.  He
has already moved his cavalry forward once.  Now he
wishes to move them again, hoping to capture a hill
that lies on the enemy’s flank. The cavalry are 65cm away
and have already moved once, which means a whopping
−4 Command penalty (−3 for distance and −1 for the second
move). The player will have to roll 5 or less to
give the unit an order.  He knows this is unlikely but
decides to take the risk anyway as he considers the hill
an important objective. He rolls 2D6 and scores 4…
success! The player moves the cavalry into their new position.#_

_[.bo5a]#Next, he attempts to give orders to a unit of infantry
10cm away# (no penalty) and within a wood (−1
dense terrain penalty). [.bo5a]#Although he only needs 8 or less, this time he
is unlucky and rolls a 10. The unit does not move – the
General has failed an order so the Orders sub-phase comes to an end.#_

.Optional rule
****
All Characters have +1 bonus to their Command
value for their first command of the first turn.
This represents a better state of organisation and
communication before the battle commences. Note
that the Command value can never exceed 10.

.A unit of cavalry charging into combat with a unit of infantry
image::the-command-phase/cavalry-charge.png[]

== Charge!

A move which brings a unit into contact with the enemy
is called a charge. A charge does not imply that the unit
concerned covers the whole distance at a mad gallop but,
nonetheless, we will use this word as a convenient and
dramatic term to describe a move into confrontation.
Units that failed to receive an order cannot charge.

Once it has charged, a unit cannot receive any further
orders that turn. It is committed to battle and must fight
in the ensuing Combat phase. See the xref::combat-phase.adoc[Combat phase
section] for further explanation.

== Brigades

In order to save time, it is permitted for an order to be
issued to up to four adjacent units simultaneously. This
means that fewer tests need to be taken to issue orders to
the entire army and ensures that units move at the same
time, maintaining a coherent battle plan. If you find this
a bit confusing, don’t worry. You can safely ignore the
Brigade rules for your first few games. Later on, once
you’ve got the hang of other aspects of the game, you can
have a go at giving orders in this way.

A brigade consists of up to four units arranged so that
they touch, forming a single body. Units comprising
a brigade at the start of the ordered movement part of
the Command phase can be given a single order and are
moved together as a body. Once it has moved, the brigade
can be given further orders if required, potentially
moving several times in just the same way as individual
units.

Bear in mind that it is not obligatory to move units as
a brigade simply because they happen to be touching
at the start of the Command phase. A brigade is not a
formal division of the army but a convenient ad hoc
formation that can be changed from one turn to the next.
Units formed up together can be given separate orders
if you prefer, or two or three units can be divided from
a larger formation and treated as a completely separate
brigade. It is really up to you whether you choose to
move touching units as a brigade or not.

****
.These three units can be formed into a brigade.
image::the-command-phase/brigade-of-three.png[]

.These four units can also be formed into a brigade. Each unit is arranged into a column that is three stands deep.
image::the-command-phase/brigade-of-four.png[]
****

To give orders to a brigade, measure to the most distant
unit in the brigade and take one test. Remember to apply
the −1 penalty if any units in the brigade are within
20cm of the enemy, in dense terrain, if the brigade has
moved before or if any units have lost casualties. Don’t
apply any penalties more than once (if two units are in
dense terrain for example) and in the case of casualties
apply the penalty for the unit which has lost the most
stands. If your test is successful, the entire brigade is in
receipt of an order, whereas if you fail, it is not and the
whole brigade moves at half pace or doesn’t move at all
depending on whether it is a first or subsequent order
(see xref::the-command-phase.adoc#giving-an-order[Giving an order]).

Assuming an order is successfully issued, the brigade can
move. Except when units wish to charge, brigades move
as a body, with each unit remaining in touch with the
brigade as a whole.

Individual units in the brigade can change their relative
positions but must still form a brigade once its move is
complete. Individual units in the brigade can change
formation as they move. No stand in any unit in the
brigade may move further than its permitted move
distance.

Conceivably, some units in a brigade might wish to charge
the enemy whilst others do not, as shown in
<<brigade-orders,the following diagrams>>.
Any units in a brigade that wish to charge do
not have to remain in touch with the rest of the brigade
as a whole. Even though a single brigade order has been
issued, individual units can always charge. They do so
individually, one at a time, exactly as if they had been
issued separate orders. Units which do not charge still
have to end their move touching.

[#brigade-orders]

image::the-command-phase/charge-from-brigade-2.png[]

image::the-command-phase/charge-from-brigade-3.svg[]

image::the-command-phase/charge-from-brigade-4.svg[]

Once a brigade has moved, the player may not want to
move the whole brigade again but might wish to move an
individual unit or subset of touching units. Alternatively,
he may wish to divide the brigade into two and move it
in two different directions. To do this, the player must
issue a separate order to each unit or sub-brigade. The
individual units or sub-sets will carry over any Command
penalty for a second or subsequent move.

Once a brigade has moved, the player must finish moving
all the units in the original brigade before he moves other
units. If he divides a brigade into two (say A and B), he
must complete the movement of each subset in turn
before moving anything else (so he must finish moving
group A, then group B and then he can move other units
in the army).

Brigades cannot use initiative as a body. Units using
initiative must be moved at the start of the Command
phase in the usual way.

During a battle, units may be moved into touch to form a
new brigade. However, a brigade cannot be formed and
subsequently moved in the same Command phase. Units
must be in a brigade at the start of the ordered movement
part of the Command phase to move as a brigade.
