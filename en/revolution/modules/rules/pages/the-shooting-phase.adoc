= The Shooting Phase

The effect of missile weapons is worked out in the
Shooting phase. This includes missile fire from
troops armed with bows, crossbows and similar weapons
as well as long ranged artillery bombardment from
weapons such as cannons and stone throwing engines.
All magic attacks also happen in this phase, such as _Balls
of Flame_ or _Death Bolts_ hurled by sorcerers.

== Attack value

Troops that carry missile weapons such as bows,
crossbows and handguns have a separate Attack value.
This is expressed as a number following a slash, thus:
3/1, where 3 is the Attack value in close combat and 1 is
the Attack value for shooting.

include::partial$attack-values.adoc[]

== Targets

Units equipped with missile weapons can shoot once in
their turn if they are in range of a suitable target they can
see. Units engaged in combat cannot shoot other than to
shoot at units that have charged them, as described later.

A unit automatically shoots at the closest enemy unit it
can see. All stands shoot at the same target unit where
possible. If two visible enemy units are equally close, the
player may choose which to shoot at. If it’s impossible
for every stand to shoot at the same enemy unit then
shooting can be divided stand by stand, though this tends
to be ineffective.

A stand must be able to see its target to shoot at it. It is
assumed to be able to see if an unobscured line of sight
can be drawn from its front base edge to the target’s
base. However to have enough space to shoot, at least
1cm of the shooting stand should have clear visibility to
the target unit. Sight is obscured by interposing terrain
(other than low terrain features such as low obstacles,
streams/rivers, marshes), other units, other stands from
the shooting unit or any features that, in reality, would
make it impractical to see or shoot. See <<sight>>.

Stands inside a wood are assumed to be able to see up to
2cm. Stands within 2cm of a wood’s edge are assumed to
be able to see outside the wood. Likewise, stands outside
the wood can see stands positioned up to 2cm within it.
This makes it possible for archers to line up at the edge
of the wood and shoot out without exposing themselves
to a charge from cavalry, chariots or other enemy for
whom the wood is impassable.

image::the-shooting-phase/sight.svg[id=sight]

Enemy units in combat are judged to be intermingled
with their opponents and don’t therefore present a
clear visible target to missile fire. They are consequently
ignored as potential targets.

Some units can see all round – they have 360 degree vision
– and you will find this indicated in the unit’s description
(for example, Wolf Riders). This means when shooting
at the enemy a line of sight can be drawn from any free
edge of any stand in the unit. However, note that even
a unit that can see all round cannot charge an enemy
unless a line of sight can be drawn form a stand’s front
edge.

== Range

Most troops have a range of 30cm with their weapons
regardless of whether they carry bows, crossbows or
whatever. The range represents the tactical area over
which the unit operates rather than the literal distance
a weapon can shoot and most missile weapons are
comparable in this respect. Of course, many artillery
pieces can shoot a large boulder, cannon ball or some
such missile quite a good distance because their tactical
role is to provide long ranged bombardment. In these
cases, special rules apply as we shall see later. Various
rules for specific weapons are also noted in the Army
Lists section.

The distance between units is measured stand by stand.
An individual stand must be in range in order to shoot.
This may result in some stands being within range whilst
others are out, even though they are in the same unit.

== How to calculate casualties

To work out the effect of missile fire, begin by adding
up the unit’s total shooting Attack value. For example, a
unit of three stands, each with a shooting Attack value
of 1, will have a total value of 3. The total value is the
number of dice rolled to determine how many hits are
scored on the target. The minimum dice roll required for
a hit is normally 4 or more. So, three dice rolls of 1, 4 and
6 equals two hits on the target.

In practice, players may find it convenient to resolve
shooting attacks from several units at once if they are
firing at the same target. This is perfectly acceptable and
saves time rolling several batches of dice. Just add up the
total number of dice rolls from all the units shooting and
roll all the dice at once.

It is harder to score a hit on a target if it is in a defended
or fortified position. In cases where some stands from
a unit are protected whilst others are not, shooters will
always target the least protected stands so long as they
are able to see them and are within range, even though
other stands may be closer. Unprotected stands must be
removed as casualties first. In cases where casualties are
likely to result in the removal of whole stands, it will be
necessary to break the dice rolling into batches so that
the appropriate penalty can be applied once all exposed
stands are destroyed. The full definitions and further
rules for troops in defended and fortified positions are
discussed in the xref::combat-phase.adoc[Combat phase section].

=== Armour

If a target unit has armour then the number of hits scored
by shooters may be potentially reduced. The target’s
Armour value is expressed as a number 6+, 5+, 4+ or 3+,
indicating the minimum dice score required to nullify a
hit. Roll one dice for each hit scored on the unit. Any
dice that scores equal to or more than the Armour value
of the unit will nullify or ‘save’ one hit. Hits nullified in
this way are ignored –they are not struck on the target
and no further account is taken of them. For example,
a unit of Empire Knights (Armour 4+) is shot at by two
units of archers which score four hits. Four dice are
rolled for Armour (one dice per hit) scoring 2, 4, 5 and
6. As any score of 4 or more equals a ‘save’, 3 hits are
nullified and the Knights suffer only one hit.

=== Removing casualties

Units can sustain a number of hits before a stand is
destroyed and this number varies depending upon how
tough and how determined the target is. Men have a
value of 3, for example, whilst dour, stubborn-minded
Dwarfs have a value of 4. Once a unit has taken a
number of hits equal to its Hits value, remove a stand
immediately. If the unit takes insufficient hits to destroy
a stand, or if it suffers enough to remove a stand with
some remaining, record any hits left over. This is most
easily done by placing a distinctively coloured dice
directly behind the unit so that it shows the number of
hits the unit has taken.

If a unit is shot at by several enemies during the Shooting
phase it may take further hits and the total may mount
up. Remove stands as casualties occur and record any
hits left over as appropriate. Once the Shooting phase is
over, any odd hits are discounted. Hits are not recorded
from one phase to another or from one turn to the next.
We assume that the regiment regroups while lightly
wounded or disaffected warriors are brought back into
the fighting ranks. Although this means that it is quite
difficult to inflict casualties by shooting, missile fire can
be used to drive back enemy units, as follows.

== Driving back enemies

At the end of the Shooting phase, units that have taken
hits during the phase are driven back by the hail of
missiles. This can be thought of as an orderly retreat
under fire or as an out-and-out flight followed by a swift
rally, depending on the distance involved. The more hits
a unit suffers, the further it is likely to be driven back.
Work out how far units are driven back once all shooting
is complete but *before* disregarding odd hits at the end
of the Shooting phase. The player whose units are being
driven back can decide the order in which drive backs
are resolved.

To determine how far units are driven back, the opposing
player rolls one dice for each hit suffered. Don’t forget
to include hits from any stands that have been removed
during the phase. Add up the total of all the dice to find
how far the unit is driven back. For example, a unit
taking two hits rolls two dice scoring 3 and 4, resulting
in the unit being driven back 7cm.

A unit that has one or more stands in a defended position
disregards the first hit suffered when working out drive
backs. This means one hit cannot cause a drive back, two
hits roll one dice, three hits roll two dice and so on.

include::partial$divider-sword.adoc[]

A unit that has 1 or more stands in a fortified position
disregards the first two hits suffered when working out
drive backs. This means one or two hits cannot cause a
drive back, three hits roll 1 dice, four hits roll 2 dice and
so on.

Units that are driven back move directly away from
the closest enemy stand that shot at them regardless of
whether that enemy inflicted any hits – this is called the
driving unit. Note that driving units will normally be
units of troops – but can also be enemy wizards if the
unit has been affected by an appropriate spell (such as
Ball of Flame).

When a unit is driven back, it is moved directly away
from the enemy without changing its formation or
orientation. The direction of the drive back is
established by placing a ruler or other straight edge
between the closest enemy stand and the closest part of
the unit as shown in the diagram above. This is similar
to an evade move as described in the xref::movement.adoc#the-path-of-evaders[Movement section],
but note that in the case of an evade, the unit
can change its formation and stands can change their
orientation as they move, in the case of a drive back, a
unit can do neither of these things but must move back
as a block. See <<drive-back>>.

=== Units confused during drive backs

Units that have been driven back may become confused
amidst the turmoil of a disorderly recoil. This is a marked
disadvantage because it means that units will be unable
to move in their following turn.

When you roll for drive back distances, any dice roll of a
6 means that the unit becomes *confused*.

Units may also become confused if they are driven back
into terrain which they can’t enter or if they are driven
back into other units, whether they are friend or foe. See
the section on xref::confusion.adoc[Confusion] for full rules.

=== Units routed by drive backs

If the Drive back dice roll is greater than the unit’s full
pace movement distance, then the unit is automatically
deemed to have fled from the battle in rout. The unit
is not moved – instead the entire unit is removed as a
casualty.

This happens rarely because units taking many hits are
usually destroyed as a result. Large monsters with many
hits are more likely to be destroyed in this fashion than
infantry or cavalry units.

image::the-shooting-phase/chariot.webp[]

== Shooting at charging enemy

Stands capable of shooting (including artillery,
appropriate monsters and some machines) and which
are not already engaged in combat, can shoot at enemy
units charging their own unit. Remember, a unit is
‘charged’ so long as it is contacted by a charging stand –
it does not matter if the unit was not the original target
of the charge.

image::the-shooting-phase/skull.webp[]

These shots represent the unit pelting the enemy with
missiles as they approach, perhaps at the very last
moment but possibly as part of a fighting withdrawal by
parties posted ahead of the unit’s main body. Shooting
in this way is an exception to the normal turn sequence
because it happens in the enemy’s turn. Shots are
worked out as soon as the charging unit has finished its
move. Shooting stands must be able to draw a line of
sight to the enemy unit at some point during the charge
move whilst it is within their weapon range. This can be
at any moment during the charge: either at the start of
the move, once it is complete or at any point in between.
Note that some troops are allowed to shoot all round (e.g.,
Wolf Riders) and they can therefore shoot by drawing a
line of sight from any edge – other troops must draw a
line of sight from their front edge as usual.

Calculate the effect of shots and remove any whole stand
casualties straight away before moving any further units.
Bear in mind that because casualties are removed at once,
this can potentially create a line of sight for another unit
to charge into a space vacated by the casualty.

Note that shots from bolt throwers can penetrate enemy
stands and affect other stands or units behind the target.
Shots are always calculated from the position of the
chargers at the beginning or at the end of their move – so
penetration can be easily calculated from the starting or
the final position of the charging unit.

Hits inflicted on the charging enemy unit are carried
over into the combat. When it comes to working out
combat results, these hits count as having been struck
in the first combat round. If enough shooting hits are
caused to destroy one or more charging stands, then
casualties are removed immediately and do not therefore
fight in the Combat phase. Remember – the total number
of shooting hits count as having been struck in the first
combat round even where whole stands have been
removed, as shown in diagrams <<shooting-at-chargers>> and <<shooting-hits-carried-over>>.

_For example, if an Archer unit inflicts two hits on a
unit of charging Knights, the Knights start the combat
with two hits outstanding and these will count towards
the combat result for the first round. If three hits were
inflicted, then one stand is removed and will not fight
in the combat – the three hits still count as having been
struck in the first combat round._

Hits on charging units don’t cause drive backs. This
is partly for convenience, as the game would quickly
become very cluttered otherwise, but it also reflects the
ability of troops to stoically advance under fire once they
have the enemy in sight. Any loss of enthusiasm is taken
into account by including any hits inflicted in the result
for the first round of fighting (see xref::combat-phase.adoc#combat-results[Combat results].

.The Archers shoot as the Knights charge.
image::the-shooting-phase/shooting-at-chargers.webp[id=shooting-at-chargers]

If a missile-armed unit is charged by two or more
enemy units, one after the other, then it can potentially
shoot more than once. When shooting at a second
or subsequent charger only those stands that are not
already engaged can fire. Remember that stands touching
corner-to-corner are engaged and so are not free to shoot
at charging enemy.

// 2 changed to Two to avoid adjacent figure number.
.Two hits are scored – not enough to remove a stand – but these hits are carried over into the first combat round.
image::the-shooting-phase/shooting-hits-carried-over.webp[id=shooting-hits-carried-over]

== Special situations

When a unit is hit by shooting or magic being already
engaged in combat or if a unit that has been shot at is
engaged in combat at the end of shooting phase then it
cannot be driven back. Any hits scored count as having
been struck in the first round of combat that turn. Note
that this will only occur in some very special situations
mostly due to magic.

== The role of missile troops

You may have realised by now that missile fire isn’t a
terribly effective way of destroying enemy units. The
number of hits inflicted will probably be insufficient to
remove a stand and any odd hits are always discounted at
the end of the phase. The most effective way to employ
missile fire is to coordinate attacks from several units at
once.

However, shooting is a very effective way of pinning
down enemy troops and driving them from strongly
defended positions. Good generals will recognise these
qualities immediately, for they are an important means
of controlling the battlefield and frustrating your
enemy’s plans.
