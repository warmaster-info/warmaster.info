= Game Values

[.bo5a]
Before progressing to the rules of the game, we will
categorise the different kinds of troops, and assign suitable
game values to each.

[.ancients]
== Armies

[.ancients]
A game of Warmaster is played between two
opposing model armies. Each side is controlled by a single
player who plans and executes his army’s moves and rolls
dice as required to determine the results of movement
and fighting.

// Here Ancients has a note about multiple players.

[.ancients]
== Stands

[.bo5a]
The playing pieces of the game are called *stands*.
There are two kinds of stands: 40mm × 20mm unit stands
and [.edit]#character stands, often round and 25mm in diameter#
[.ancients]#in order to readily distinguish
them from troop stands.#
[.edit]#See xref:characters.adoc#odd-size-character-bases[Odd size character bases] if you have characters mounted on larger bases.#

[.ancients]
Models are mounted onto the stands so that they form
representative bodies of troops or characters. The
actual number of models and their positioning is a matter
of aesthetic choice and is left up to players.

[.ancients]
All unit stands have front, side and rear edges
as indicated by the direction faced by the models. It is
important that the direction faced by the stand is obvious
as in the examples below.

== Units

Infantry, cavalry and most other types of troops fight in
formations of several [.edit]#40mm × 20mm# stands [.ancients]#called *units*#.
A number of stands form a regiment of infantry,
a squadron of cavalry, a battery of artillery, and so on.
All the stands in the same formation are always arranged
so they are touching, either side-by-side, one behind the
other, or contacting at a point. [.ancients]#This is referred to as
a *formation*.#

////
//Removed WMR:
For convenience, we shall refer to all of these formations as *units*.
////

Units usually consist of three stands of the same
type but this can vary and sometimes a unit can be just a
single stand, as we shall see later.

////
// Removed WMR (from box)
Troops are arranged into units consisting of a number of
‘stands’ – usually three but sometimes two or even just
one. This page shows typical infantry and cavalry units.
////

// TODO Remove/move later (WMR)
Up to four units can be temporarily placed together to
form a *brigade*. We’ll be covering brigades in much more
detail in the rules that follow.

== Characters

In addition to the troops described, armies always include
a General and can include other Heroes and Wizards
as well. These consist of a single stand which includes
the mighty individual as well as assorted helpmates and
hangers on. These stands are referred to as characters.

// Moved up like Ancients/Bo5A
== Infantry, cavalry, chariots, monsters, artillery & machines

Broadly speaking, armies consist of infantry, cavalry,
chariots, monsters, artillery and machines – this last
category includes various oddball devices, as we shall
discover.

The rules distinguish between these six types of troops.
Monstrous creatures of small to medium size are usually
classified as either cavalry or infantry – Ogres are clearly
infantry, for instance, although their appearance is no
less monstrous for all that.

// Moved out of the box.

Infantry stands are always oriented along the long edge
of the base as demonstrated by the Empire unit shown
above.

.An Empire cavalry unit
image::game-values/cavalry-1.webp[]

// Replace with a monster or artillery
// image::game-values/cavalry-2.webp[]

Generally speaking, all other troops, including
monsters and artillery as well as chariots, cavalry and
machines are oriented towards the short edge of the base
as demonstrated by the units shown to the right. Any
exceptions are indicated in the Army Lists section.

[.h-bo5a]
== Attacks, hits & armour values

Some troops are better fighters than others, some are
better trained, some are more naturally violent and
so on. So that we can represent these different qualities
in the warriors, monsters and weird creatures that are
found in the game, we assign three values to each piece
or ‘stand’. These are *Attacks*, *Hits* and *Armour*.

image::game-values/attacks-hits-armour.webp[]

[cols="3*^",frame=none,grid=cols]
|===
|Attacks |Hits |Armour

|3       |3    |6+
|↙       |↓    | ↘

<|This is the
basic number
of dice rolled
in combat –
the more dice,
the better at
fighting the
stand is and
the more hits
it will be able
to inflict.
^|The number of
hits the stand
can suffer
before it is
removed.
>|The stand’s Armour
value indicates the
chance of nullifying
hits scored against
it. A value of 6+
indicates that a dice
roll of 6 is required
to nullify a hit, a
5+ that a 5 or 6 is
required and so on.
A value of 0 means
that the stand has
no armour.
|===

=== Shooting attacks

If troops carry bows or other missile weapons then they
will have two Attack dice values divided by a slash,
for example 3/1 or 2/2. In this case, the first number is
always that used in hand-to-hand combat and the second
value is that used for shooting.

[.h-ancients]
== Command values

// Removed: your General and other important
Command is another game value and a very important
one too! Only
characters have a Command value and they use it when
issuing orders. Values vary from as low as 7 to as high as
10 but only the very best Generals have a value as high as
10.
[.bo5a]#The higher the
value, the more likely you are to be able to order your troops to
do what you want them to.#
More about command in due course.

[.ancients]
== Points values

[.bo5a]
Each unit and character in the game is assigned a points value
which reflects its worth in the game – the more effective units
and characters having an appropriately higher value. Once the
battle is finished, the total points value of each side’s casualties
determines who wins.
[.edit]#Otherwise,# points values don’t really affect the rules
of play.

[.ancients]
.Stat line
****
A unit’s game values can be conveniently expressed as a single line of statistics or ‘stat line’ as shown below.

image::game-values/boar-riders.webp[]

[.unit,frame=none]
|===
|Type |Attack |Hits |Armour |Command |Unit size |Points |Min/max | Special

|Cavalry |4 |3 |5+ |– |3 |110 |–/– |–
|===

Type:: [.edit]#The types are Infantry, Cavalry, Chariot, Monster, Artillery, Machine, General, Hero, Wizard.#

Attack:: The basic number of dice rolled in combat by each stand in the unit.

Hits:: The number of hits the unit can suffer before one stand is removed.

Armour:: The dice score required to negate a hit inflicted on the unit.

Command:: The command value of a General, Hero or Wizard.

Unit size:: The number of stands in the unit – this is usually 3.

Min/max:: This values is used to delimit the number of units and characters that can be chosen for the army – see the xref:revolution:armies:index.adoc[Army Lists].

Points:: The points value of a unit of that type.

Special:: [.bo5a]#This column indicates if any special rules apply.#

== Measuring

Players are free to measure distances at any time, and
in many cases this will be necessary to determine which
target to shoot at or charge. There is no restriction
on measurement during play itself; players can take
measurements as and when they wish.
////

== Anything else to learn?

Most armies have unique troops of one kind or another,
many of which have special rules to reflect their
sorcerous and fantastical abilities. You don’t need to
know about these to begin with, so don’t worry about
them. Later you’ll see that this is what makes each army
a different and challenging force to command.

[.bo5a]
== Visibility on the battlefield

[.bo5a]
During the game, players will want their units to shoot at or
charge enemies or evade them. In these, and many other
cases, it is important to know if troops can see their enemy and
if they can react to them in an effective and cohesive way.

[.bo5a]
[.ancients]#This concept underpins many parts of the game rules – so
we’re going to explain it here before anything else.#
As players we can easily see all that is happening on the
battlefield. For our armies things are quite different. Not only is
there the matter of distance but also the subtle rise and fall of the
ground, the haze of the midday sun, the mist of early morning,
the fading twilight, the dust thrown up by rival armies, etc. Due
to this, when we talk of units seeing other units, or units being
visible, we use these terms in a specific sense. When we say a
unit can ‘see’ another, we don’t mean one or two warriors can
theoretically see – we mean that the whole unit, including its
commanders, is positioned to observe and react cohesively to the
presence of the enemy.

[.ancients]
=== Line of sight

////
// Warmaster Original text from Movement chapter:
A unit is assumed to be able to see another if it is possible
to draw an uninterrupted line of sight between the *front*
edge of any stand and any stand in the other unit. It is
not possible to see through unit stands from either side,
or terrain other than low features such as low obstacles,
rivers/streams etc. Characters never block line of sight
(see the Generals, Wizards and Heroes section).
////

[.ancients]
A unit can see another if it is possible to draw a straight,
uninterrupted line of sight between the *front edge*
of any of the unit’s stands and *any part* of any stand in the
other unit (see <<line-of-sight-target>>. It is always the stands themselves that are
considered when working out line of sight and not the
actual models, which are likely to vary in height in any
case. The best way of doing this is to run a straight edge,
for example a measuring rule, between the observer
and observed.

.{empty}
image::game-values/line-of-sight-target.svg[id=line-of-sight-target]

[.ancients]
It is not permitted to draw a line of light over the top of
unit stands from either side. These are said to ‘block’ the
line of sight (see <<line-of-sight-blocked>>).

.{empty}
image::game-values/line-of-sight-blocked.svg[id=line-of-sight-blocked]

[.ancients]
Character stands never block line of sight. They
represent only a few individuals so it is assumed units see
through them as if they were not there.
[.bo5a]#See xref:characters.adoc[Generals, Heroes & Wizards].#

[.wmr]
Some units can see all round – they have 360 degree
vision [.edit]#as shown in <<line-of-sight-360>># – and you will find this indicated in the unit’s
description.
[.bo5a]#These are invariably either flying units or lightly
armed troops that fight in a very loosely organised style,#
for example, Wolf Riders in the Orc army.

.{empty}
image::game-values/line-of-sight-360.svg[id=line-of-sight-360]

[.ancients]
=== The effect of terrain

[.ancients]
Some terrain (such as areas of ruins, hills and woods)
block line of sights as described in the Movement rules.
In principle, line of sight is blocked where it
passes through any kind of terrain feature, but there are
appropriate and mostly obvious exceptions. For example,
it is always considered possible to see over low linear
features such as hedges and low walls (see <<line-of-sight-terrain>>.
The section on xref:movement.adoc#terrain[Terrain] explains the rules governing this.

.{empty}
image::game-values/line-of-sight-terrain.svg[id=line-of-sight-terrain]

////
// This is in Ancients and Bo5A, but seems to conflict with
// flying units being able to see 100cm (at least) for their move/charge.
// I can't find it in the Revolution PDF.
[.ancients]
=== Maximum visibility

[.bo5a]
It is convenient to set a limit upon the maximum distance a unit
can see. The maximum visibility in ordinary circumstances is
60cm. It would be easy to imagine situations where visibility
would be considerably reduced – persistent rain, mist or at night
for example. Rather than worry about these exceptions for the
moment, a maximum visibility of 60cm is taken as standard
and units more distant than this are assumed to be hidden from view.
