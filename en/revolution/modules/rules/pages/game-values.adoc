= Game Values

Some troops are better fighters than others, some are
better trained, some are more naturally violent and
so on. So that we can represent these different qualities
in the warriors, monsters and weird creatures that are
found in the game, we assign three values to each piece
or ‘stand’. These are *Attacks*, *Hits* and *Armour*.

|===
|Attacks |Hits |Armour

|3       |3    |6+
|↙       |↓    | ↘

<|This is the
basic number
of dice rolled
in combat –
the more dice,
the better at
fighting the
stand is and
the more hits
it will be able
to inflict.
^|The number of
hits the stand
can suffer
before it is
removed.
>|The stand’s Armour
value indicates the
chance of nullifying
hits scored against
it. A value of 6+
indicates that a dice
roll of 6 is required
to nullify a hit, a
5+ that a 5 or 6 is
required and so on.
A value of 0 means
that the stand has
no armour.

=== Infantry, cavalry, chariots, monsters, artillery & machines

Broadly speaking, armies consist of infantry, cavalry,
chariots, monsters, artillery and machines – this last
category includes various oddball devices, as we shall
discover.

The rules distinguish between these six types of troops.
Monstrous creatures of small to medium size are usually
classified as either cavalry or infantry – Ogres are clearly
infantry, for instance, although their appearance is no
less monstrous for all that.

=== Shooting attacks

If troops carry bows or other missile weapons then they
will have two Attack dice values divided by a slash,
for example 3/1 or 2/2. In this case, the first number is
always that used in hand-to-hand combat and the second
value is that used for shooting.

== Command

Command is another game value and a very important
one too! Only your General and other important
characters have a Command value and they use it when
issuing orders. Values vary from as low as 7 to as high as
10 but only the very best Generals have a value as high as
10. More about command in due course.

== Units

Infantry, cavalry and most other types of troops fight in
formations of several stands each consisting of a number
of miniatures glued to a 40mm × 20mm Warmaster
base. A number of stands form a regiment of infantry,
a squadron of cavalry, a battery of artillery, and so on.
All the stands in the same formation are always arranged
so they are touching, either side-by-side, one behind the
other, or contacting at a point.

For convenience, we shall refer to all of these formations
as *units*. Units usually consist of three stands of the same
type but this can vary and sometimes a unit can be just a
single stand, as we shall see later.

Up to four units can be temporarily placed together to
form a *brigade*. We’ll be covering brigades in much more
detail in the rules that follow.

== Characters

In addition to the troops described, armies always include
a General and can include other Heroes and Wizards
as well. These consist of a single stand which includes
the mighty individual as well as assorted helpmates and
hangers on. These stands are referred to as characters.

== Measuring

Players are free to measure distances at any time, and
in many cases this will be necessary to determine which
target to shoot at or charge. There is no restriction
on measurement during play itself; players can take
measurements as and when they wish.

== Anything else to learn?

Most armies have unique troops of one kind or another,
many of which have special rules to reflect their
sorcerous and fantastical abilities. You don’t need to
know about these to begin with, so don’t worry about
them. Later you’ll see that this is what makes each army
a different and challenging force to command.

Troops are arranged into units consisting of a number of
‘stands’ – usually three but sometimes two or even just
one. This page shows typical infantry and cavalry units.

Infantry stands are always oriented along the long edge
of the base as demonstrated by the Empire unit shown
above. Generally speaking, all other troops, including
monsters and artillery as well as chariots, cavalry and
machines are oriented towards the short edge of the base
as demonstrated by the units shown to the right. Any
exceptions are indicated in the Army Lists section.
