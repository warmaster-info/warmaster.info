= Generals, Wizards & Heroes

Generals, Wizards and Heroes are represented by a
single stand which includes the great man himself
plus his bodyguard, standard bearer, familiars, servants,
messengers, observers, courtiers, pets, jesters, toadies
and other such hangers-on as make up his immediate
entourage. For the sake of convenience, Generals,
Wizards and Heroes are referred to as characters.

== Game values

In some armies, Generals, Wizards and Heroes have
different names such as Liche priests in the Undead
army and Shamans in the Orc army. Names apart, they
amount to the same thing and each is either a General,
Wizard or Hero as indicated in the Army Lists section of
the rulebook.

Unlike troop stands Character stands don’t
have a value for Hits or Armour. Instead they
have a Command value. They have no Hits
value at all. They have an Attack value which
is expressed as a bonus, for example +1, +2, +3,
etc. The picture below shows an Empire Hero
stand with its game values. Full game values
for all characters can be found in the Army
List section.

== Characters as game pieces

Characters are different from other pieces in the game.
Most stands of infantry or other warriors represent a
substantial body of troops defined by the stand’s area.
Characters represent a comparatively tiny number
of actual individuals, some of whom may be scattered
across the battlefield in the role of messengers, scouts
and observers.

The character stand’s prime function is to provide a
fixed point from which orders are issued. In addition
a character stand can bolster a unit’s combat ability by
joining it. In the case of Wizards they can also cast spells,
some of which are directly offensive in nature.

Because of their unique place in the game, character
stands are treated differently to units of troops. A
character stand is used much more in the manner of
a token or marker. The stand itself is ignored on the
battlefield by units from both sides.

Units from their own side can move through characters
without penalty and they, in turn, can move through
units from their own side. If friendly units are moved
in such a way that they displace a character then the
player must immediately move the character by the
minimum distance required to allow the unit to take
up its position. This may result in a character moving
several times during the Command phase to get out of
the way of troop movement.

If moved through by enemies, characters are repositioned
as described below.

Characters can also be seen through and, where
appropriate, shot through by troops from both sides.
Their presence is not considered to block a unit’s line
of sight.

It follows that characters cannot be specifically shot at,
targeted with spells or attacked in combat. Characters
don’t suffer hits from shooting or combat, although
they can be slain if a unit they are with is destroyed,
as described later. A character stand on its own cannot
charge or fight an enemy unit.

include::partial$divider-axe.adoc[]

It is worth bearing in mind that character stands are
always ignored when considering which enemy target is
the closest and when measuring between units. Similarly,
an enemy unit cannot act on its initiative with regard to a
character and the presence of an enemy character within
20cm does not impose a −1 Command penalty.

== Characters & terrain

// Spelling i.e.
// "Monstrous and Chariot Mounts" is "Character Mounts".
Unless riding monsters or chariots, character stands
ignore terrain in the same way as infantry. Only terrain
which is impossible for infantry to cross is impossible
for characters (i.e, a character cannot move across the
open ocean, into a volcanic lake and so forth). If riding
monsters or chariots, characters are restricted by terrain
in the same way as these troops. See <<character-mounts>>.

== Orders from wizards & heroes

We have already described how characters give orders in
the Command phase.

Any character can issue an order to any unit or brigade
within his command range. The General’s command
range extends over the whole battlefield but a Hero can
only issue orders to units within 60cm of the character
stand and a Wizard can only issue an order to a unit
within 20cm of the character stand.

[frame=none,grid=rows]
|===
|Character |Command Range

|General   |Battlefield
|Hero      |60cm
|Wizard    |20cm
|===

A player can issue orders from his characters in any
sequence he wishes but must finish issuing orders from
each character before moving to the next. For example,
you can’t issue orders from the General then from a
Hero and then from the General again.

Once a Hero or Wizard has failed to issue an order, that
character can issue no more orders in that Command
phase. However, other characters can continue issuing
orders until they too fail to issue an order. Once the
General has failed to give an order, *no further orders* can
be issued in that Command phase by *any* characters even
if they have issued no orders previously. This makes it
preferable for Heroes and Wizards to issue orders first
and the General last, although this is not mandatory. A
player may occasionally prefer to await the outcome of
his General’s attempts to issue orders before committing
a Wizard or Hero.

== Blunders

Wizards and Heroes are not always reliable. We presume
that the General has briefed them concerning his battle
plan, carefully instructed them in their duties and taken
pains to make everything as clear as possible. In a perfect
world this should be sufficient but, alas, this is rarely so.
Some underlings are plain dim and so misunderstand
their orders. Others get carried away and charge off in
pursuit of a new and exciting goal. A few are quick to
ignore their General’s orders in favour of their own plan.

This wayward inclination is taken into account whenever
a Wizard or Hero fails to issue an order as a result of
rolling a 12. If the player rolls a 12 then not only is the
order not issued but something has gone wrong. Someone
has blundered. The Wizard or Hero has got carried away
or ignored the instructions he has been given or taken a
wrong turning or mistaken a wandering group of locals
for the enemy. The player rolls a dice and consults the
Blunder table. The result applies to the unit which has
failed to receive its order and to all units in the case of
a brigade, except where noted otherwise. If it is the first
order to the unit/brigade then the half pace move is not
allowed. Follow the result of the Blunder table instead.

General doesn’t blunder. However, if the General rolls
a 12 the unit/brigade cannot move even if it was its first
order and therefore it was eligible for a half pace move.

[discrete]
==== D6 Blunder

*1 You must be crazy!*::
+
--
The unit’s officers are seriously bewildered by their
orders and insist on disputing their interpretation.
This takes a long time during which tempers fray,
fists fly and some officers storm off determined to
spend the rest of the battle undermining the efforts
of their rivals. The unit suffers a −1 Command
penalty for the rest of the battle. If a brigade has
blundered then this penalty applies to one unit and
the player can choose which is affected. The penalty
will apply to the whole brigade if an order is given
to the brigade that includes the affected unit. This
penalty is cumulative so it’s theoretically possible
for a unit’s effectiveness to plummet to a seriously
incompetent level. The unit/brigade may not move
further that Command phase.
--

*2–3 Blimey Sir! There’s thousands of ’em!*::
+
--
The unit’s officers mistake a shabby group of curious
locals for a huge enemy force. If there are no visible
enemy units within a full pace move of the unit or
brigade then the unit/brigade halts and in this case
there is no further penalty. If there are visible enemy
units within a full pace move of the blundering unit
or brigade then the unit or each unit in a brigade
must move the shortest route to get outside a full
pace move from all enemy units. Where units have
different moves, the brigade moves at the speed of
the slowest. Once it has moved, the unit/brigade
halts. If unable to comply, the unit/brigade moves
as far away from all enemy units as possible instead.
--

*4–5 No sense in getting killed sir!*::
+
--
The unit’s officers are timorous and hesitant,
convinced that the unit is surrounded by enemy and
unseen dangers. The unit/brigade may not move and
cannot receive any further orders that Command
phase.
--

*6 Up and ’at ’em, men!*::
--
The troops are overcome by a sudden and
uncontrollable lust for glory and surge forwards
out of control. The unit must move at its maximum
full pace towards the nearest visible enemy unit and
will charge the nearest enemy unit if it is possible to
do so. If a whole brigade goes ‘up and ’at ’em!’ then
move each unit one at a time as the movement of one
may affect the ability of subsequent units to charge
because it blocks sight or access to base edges. Once
units have moved, they halt as for a normal failed
order. Once units have moved, or there is no visible
enemy, they halt. The unit/brigade cannot receive
any further orders that Command phase.

== Character movement

We have already covered the essentials of character
movement in the Movement section. To summarise:

. Characters move at the end of the Command phase
  and never move in company with units during the
  Command phase.

. A character can move once up to 60cm (100cm if
  flying). No Command test is required for a character
  to move.

. Characters move in company with units they have
  joined in other phases. For example, if they are
  driven back by missile fire, move to make way for
  other units, and throughout the Combat phase
  during pursuit, fall backs, retreats and advances

image::generals-wizards-and-heroes/tusks.png[]

== Joining a unit

A character may join a unit by moving into touch with
it at the end of the Command phase. The player declares
that the character is now with the unit. A character can
join a unit which is in combat if you wish. Players should
be careful not to place characters touching units if they
are not intended to be joined and should always leave a
discernible gap where this makes the position clear.

A character must also join a unit if he is obliged to move
as a result of enemy troop movement. In this case, he
must move into touch with a friendly unit within a 30cm
move as described opposite.

If a character is joined with a unit which is confused, this
does not prevent the character from moving at the end
of the Command phase. Nor does it prevent him issuing
orders to other units during the Command phase itself.

The precise position of the character stand relative to
a unit he has joined is not critical. Once he has joined
a unit, the character himself is assumed to be within
the unit’s formation. Once a character has joined a
unit, his stand may be moved to any point around the
unit as required, for example so that another unit can
charge into position or move alongside. The character
stand must remain in touch with the unit at some point
if possible. If this is impossible, if the unit is in combat
and completely surrounded for example, the player can
temporarily balance the character stand in the middle
of the unit or say that he is doing so whilst placing the
stand safely aside. A character joined with a unit that is
locked in unresolved combat can still issue orders in the
Command phase. Nominate a stand in the unit and work
out the measuring of the distance to the commanded
unit from that stand.

== Enemy moving through characters

If a lone character gets in the way of enemy units as
they move then the character stand must be moved up
to 30cm to join a friendly unit. Flying units fly over the
battlefield as they move and so only displace characters
if their move ends on top of them. Character stands
cannot be moved so that they displace enemy characters.
Note that a displaced character does not have to join the
closest unit, the player can decide which unit to join.

If a character cannot move to a friendly unit, he is
considered to have been slain and is removed from
the battle. If the General is slain, the battle is over as
described in the xref:end-of-the-battle.adoc[End of The Battle].

This is an important rule because it obliges characters to
remain fairly close to their own troops, especially Wizards
who might otherwise exploit their invulnerability to
launch unsupported magical attacks deep behind enemy
lines.

include::partial$divider-sword.adoc[]

If a character is with a unit when it makes contact with
a moving enemy then the character can be repositioned
out of the way as convenient, so long as he stays in touch
with the unit he is with. If this is impossible (if the unit
is surrounded, for example) then the character can be
precariously balanced on top of the unit or removed but
assumed to be included within the unit’s formation.

== Characters & shooting

Characters cannot be shot at but may have joined a unit
which is shot at and either been driven back or destroyed
as a result. If a character is with a unit that has been
driven back by shooting, he automatically moves with it.

If a character has joined a unit that is subsequently
destroyed by shooting or which is routed and destroyed
as a result of a drive back then the character is slain.

Monster mounted characters or other characters that
have a shooting attack when joined to units are assumed
to be within the unit’s formation regardless of the
actual position of the character stand. When shooting
in the Shooting phase, or during the Command phase if
shooting at chargers, the player chooses one of the unit’s
stands and works out the character’s shooting from that
stand. All shots taken at the same enemy unit have to
be worked out from the same stand, but otherwise the
character can ‘move’ from stand to stand during the
turn as required (this can happen during the opposing
player’s Command phase if the unit is charged by more
than one enemy for example). The same principle applies
to characters casting spells.

== Characters in combat

When one or more characters join a unit in combat, the
character with the highest Attack value can add this as a
bonus to the Attack value of any one stand in the unit. A
unit may be joined by any number of characters but only
one character can ever add his Attack value bonus to a
unit per round of combat.

Character stands which have joined a unit in combat
must remain with it whilst the combat lasts and must
fall back, stand their ground, retreat, pursue or advance
with the unit.

A General, Wizard or Hero is slain if the unit he is with
is destroyed. This is of particular importance as it makes
combat an extremely risky business for characters and
certainly not something to be indulged in lightly.

== Character mounts

// Spelling modelled
If you read the Army Lists section you’ll see that
Generals, Wizards and Heroes are often allowed to ride
on some sort of monster or in a chariot. In the case of
monsters these are referred to as *Monstrous Mounts* and
chariots are *Chariot Mounts*. Sometimes characters are
allowed to ride on some *Special Mounts* that have their
own special description in appropriate army lists. In
all other cases where characters are modelled riding on
common mounts (or simply *mounts*) like horses, wolves
and similar creatures, they do so for free.

If a character rides either a Monstrous or Chariot Mount
this does not affect the rules described above. The stand
is still a General, Wizard or Hero stand for our purposes.
However, the mount will usually increase the character’s
Attack value bonus in combat. Chariot and Monster
Mount bonuses are added to the character’s normal
Combat bonus. In addition, there may be special rules
that apply. For example, a General riding a Monstrous
Mount may cause terror. These rules are noted in the
Army Lists.

It is quite common for characters to ride some sort
of flying creature such as a Griffon or a Dragon. This
increases the rider’s maximum movement to 100cm.

A flying character is not affected by normally impassable
terrain because it can fly right over it in the same way as
other flying stands.

A character riding a chariot or a monster cannot move
into terrain that his mount could not enter. He cannot
enter a wood for example. He cannot join a unit if all
of its stands are in a wood. If a unit he is with retreats,
falls back, pursues, is driven back, advances or is
otherwise obliged to move into a wood he must move
up to 30cm to another unit in the same way as a lone
character contacted by the enemy. If he cannot do so, he
is slain. However, so long as at least one stand in a unit is
positioned in unrestricted terrain, the character can join
the unit.

Note that common mounts such as horses, wolves, boars
and similar creatures are not accorded any special rules,
and characters riding these are simply treated the same
way as characters on foot.

== Odd size character bases

Characters are mounted on standard sized bases in the
same way as troop stands – however many players prefer
to mount their characters on round bases as this makes
them easier to spot. In addition, some of the special
character models, such as the Grand Theogonist, are too
large to fit onto the standard sized base.

Character stands can be mounted onto round bases up
to 25mm in diameter using the normal rules. Simply
measure distances to the stand’s edge as you would for
a rectangular base. This confers no significant advantage
over a standard base.

Character stands can be mounted onto larger bases,
whether rectangular, round or whatever, but in these
cases all distances must be measured either to the centre
of the base or to a specific point on the base such as a
particular model. Players must point out where they
will measure from before the game. Oversized bases are
slightly inconvenient in play, but allow for some very
nice decorative models or more complex scenes and do
look very attractive.
